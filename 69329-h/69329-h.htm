<h2 class="main">PREFACE.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The following is an exposition of the first of the five books called Megiloth, all
of which, having engaged the attention of the Author for several years, will now,
God willing, be brought before the Public in regular succession. The Author’s aim
has been to investigate and elucidate the true meaning of the original, in accordance
with the established laws of historico-grammatical exegesis, and to show that, in
its literal sense, the Song of Songs teaches a great moral lesson, worthy of Divine
inspiration.
</p>
<p>The resemblance, however, between the narrative here recorded and the experience of
the people of God is striking and apposite. The Shulamite, espoused to her shepherd,
is tempted by a mighty potentate with riches and pleasures to transfer her affections;
but, strengthened by the power of divine love, she resists all temptation, remains
faithful to her beloved, and is ultimately rewarded. The people of God, espoused to
“the Shepherd and Bishop of their souls,” are tempted by the prince of this world
to forsake their Lord, but, strengthened by grace divine, they resist all allurements,
and eventually receive the crown of glory.
</p>
<p>The references to Genesius’ and Ewald’s Grammars are to the last editions, which differ
in the numbering of the sections from the earlier ones; Fürst’s valuable Lexicon,
to which frequent reference is made, is not yet completed.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb.viii">[<a href="#pb.viii">viii</a>]</span></p>
<p>The author tenders his hearty thanks to his esteemed friend, the Rev. Isaac Salkinson
of Hamburg; to the Rev. J.&nbsp;M. Charlton, A.M.; the Rev. R. Robinson, of York-road;
the Rev. G. Rogers, of Albany-road; and to Nathaniel Bridges, Esq., A.M., for perusing
the MS. and proofs, and for kind suggestions. Thanks are also due to those gentlemen
in London and Oxford, who have facilitated the author’s access to MSS. and other rare
works in the British Museum and the Bodleian Library.
</p>
<p>May the Divine Spirit, whose words the Author has attempted to elucidate, render the
attempt profitable to the readers!

<h3 class="main">SECTION I.—TITLE OF THE BOOK, AND ITS SIGNIFICATION.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This book is called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שִׁיר הַשִּׁירִיﬦ‎</span>, which is literally translated by the Septuagint, <span class="trans" title="asma asmatōn"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ᾄσμα ᾀσμάτων</span></span>, by the Vulgate, <i lang="la">Canticum Canticorum</i>, and by the English Version, <i>Song of Songs</i>; and, according to a Hebrew mode for expressing the superlative degree by repeating
the same noun in the genitive, denotes <i>the finest</i>, <i>the most beautiful</i>, or <i>the most excellent</i> Song. Compare <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עֶבֶד עֲבַדִים‎</span>, <i>servant of servants</i>, <i>i.e.</i> most abject servant (Gen. ix. 25); <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קֹדֶשׁ קָדָשִׁים‎</span>, <i>holy of holies</i>, <i>i.e.</i> most holy (Exod. xxix. 37; Numb. iii. 32; Deut. x. 14; Eccl. i. 2; Hos. x. 15; Jer.
vi. 28; Gesenius, Grammar, § 119, 2; Ewald, Lehrbuch, § 313, c). Medrash Yalkut renders
it <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שִׁיר הַמְּשׁוּבַּח וְהַמְּעוּלֶה בַּשִּׁירִים‎</span>, <i>a song more celebrated and sublime than all songs</i>; as Rashi, Ibn Ezra Rashbam, Luther, and many others. The opinion of Kleuker, &amp;c.,
that this interpretation of the Rabbins is more owing to their preconceived notion
of the sublime contents of the book than to the real meaning of these words, is refuted
by Rashbam himself, who, having explained this phrase by “most excellent song,” refers
not to the contents of the book for its corroboration, but adduces similar constructions
of the superlative from other passages of the Bible, viz., <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֶלֹהַי הַאֱלֹהִים‎</span>, and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֲדוֹנֵי הַאֲדוֹנִים‎</span> (Deut. x. 17). Other explanations, such as a song of songs, <i>i.e.</i> a song <i>from</i> the songs of Solomon (Kimchi), or a collection of songs (Kleuker), or a chain of
songs, or string of strings, comparing <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שִׁירֹ‎</span> with the Chaldee <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שֵׁיר‎</span>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שׁוּרָה‎</span>, Greek <span class="trans" title="seira"><span lang="grc" class="grek">σειρὰ</span></span>, <i>chain</i> (Velthusen, Paulus, Good, &amp;c.), are contrary to the Hebrew usage of the word <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שִׁיר‎</span>, and the construction of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שִׁיר הַשִּׁירִים‎</span>. More recent commentators, <span class="pageNum" id="pb2">[<a href="#pb2">2</a>]</span>and even those who regard this book as a collection of separate songs (as, for instance,
Döpke, Magnus, Noyes, &amp;c.) admit that the Rabbinical interpretation of this title
is the only admissible one. The <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ל‎</span> prefixed to <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שְׁלֹמֹה‎</span>, is the so-called <i>Lamed auctoris</i>, used in the inscriptions of Psalms and other Hebrew poems to designate <i>the author</i>. Comp. Ps. iii. 1; iv. 1, &amp;c. The addition of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֲשֶׁר‎</span> here, which is not found in the other inscriptions, is owing to the article in <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שִׁיר הַשִּׁירִים‎</span>, which generally, though not always, is followed by this pronoun; comp. Gen. xxix.
9; xl. 5; xlvii. 4; 1 Kings iv. 2; Gesen. § 115, 1; Ewald, 292 a. The rendering therefore
of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֲשֶׁר לִשְׁלֹמֹה‎</span> by <i>respecting Solomon</i>, is contrary to usage, and is rightly rejected by modern grammarians and lexicographers.
</p>
<p>This Song is the first of the (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הָמֵשׁ מְגִילוֹת‎</span>) <i>five Megiloth</i>, or books which are annually read in the Synagogues; viz. The Song of Songs on the
Feast of the Passover; Ruth on Pentecost; Lamentations on the Ninth of Ab; Ecclesiastes
on Tabernacles; and Esther on Purim. The present arrangement of these five books in
the Hebrew canon is according to the order of the festivals on which they are read.

<h3 class="main">SECTION II.—CANONICITY OF THE BOOK.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This book possesses all the external marks which entitle other writings to a place
in the list of the sacred books. The evidence for its canonicity is as conclusive
as that which is commonly adduced to prove the canonicity of any other portion of
the Old Testament. In the Mishna Yadim (sect. iii. 5), we find the following testimony
respecting it from R. Akiba, one of the most celebrated Rabbins, who lived at the
end of the first century, and was president of the academy of Bani-Brac: <i>No Israelite has ever disputed the canonicity of the Song of Songs. No day in the
whole history of the world is of so much worth as the one in which the Song of Songs
was given to Israel; for all the Scriptures are holy, but the Song of Songs is most
holy.</i> Another Rabbi (<i>Simeon b. Azzai</i>), in the same place, says, <i>I <span class="pageNum" id="pb3">[<a href="#pb3">3</a>]</span>received it from the mouth of the seventy-two elders, at the time when R. Eliezer
b. Azzaria was appointed Elder, that the Song of Songs and Ecclesiastes are canonical</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e466src" href="#xd31e466">1</a> We have here positive evidence that this book existed in the canon in the Apostolic
age; and that it was comprised in the sacred books, which our Lord calls <span class="trans" title="tas graphas"><span lang="grc" class="grek">τὰς γραφὰς</span></span>, <i>the Scriptures</i>, Matt. xxii. 29. It has, therefore, been transmitted to us both by the Jewish and
Christian churches as canonical. It was translated into Greek, between the years 90
and 130, by Aquila, who was anxious to furnish his Jewish brethren with a faithful
version of the <i>sacred</i> books; and also by Symmachus and Theodotion, before the end of the second century.
It is contained in the catalogue given in the Talmud;<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e527src" href="#xd31e527">2</a> and in the catalogue of Melito, Bishop of Sardis (fl. 170, <span class="asc">A.D.</span>), which he brought from Palestine, whither this learned and pious prelate expressly
travelled to <span class="pageNum" id="pb4">[<a href="#pb4">4</a>]</span>obtain information respecting the number of the sacred books.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e535src" href="#xd31e535">3</a> Those who in modern days have questioned the canonicity of this book have done so,
not from external evidence, but from misapprehension of its design.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="s3" class="div2 section"><span class="pageNum">[<a href="#xd31e252">Contents</a>]</span><div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">SECTION III.—DESIGN AND METHOD OF THE BOOK.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We have no sympathy with those who affirm that the Old Testament Scriptures contain
all the national writings which were esteemed valuable in Hebrew literature, that
this Song was placed among those writings simply because it possessed much poetic
beauty, and was supposed to be the composition of a person so celebrated throughout
the East as Solomon, and that it is destitute of any moral or practical instructions.
We believe that every book of the Old Testament is inspired; and has, on that account,
obtained a place in the Hebrew Canon. This is the unanimous testimony, not of the
Jewish church only, but is corroborated by Christ and his apostles. Paul, referring
to the Old Testament, most distinctly affirms, that “all Scripture is given by inspiration
of God; and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction
in righteousness.” 2 Tim. iii. 16.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e542src" href="#xd31e542">4</a> As this Song undoubtedly formed a part of the Scriptures to which the apostle alluded,
it must, therefore, be inspired, and must serve some of those purposes of inspiration.
</p>
<p>The particular design of this book has been much disputed. It is here maintained,
that, upon careful examination, it will be found to record <i>an example of virtue in a young woman who encountered and conquered the greatest temptations,
and was, eventually, rewarded</i>; the simple narrative of which, divested of its poetic form, is as follows. There
was a family living at Shulem, consisting of a widowed mother, several sons, and one
daughter, who maintained themselves by farming and <span class="pageNum" id="pb5">[<a href="#pb5">5</a>]</span>pasturage. The brothers were particularly partial to their sister, and took her under
their special care, promising that her prudence and virtue should be greatly rewarded
by them. In the course of time, while tending the flock, and, according to the custom
of the shepherds, resorting at noon beneath a tree for shelter against the meridian
sun, she met with a graceful shepherd youth, to whom she afterwards became espoused.
One morning, in the spring, this youth invited her to accompany him into the field;
but the brothers, overhearing the invitation, and anxious for the reputation of their
sister, in order to prevent their meeting, sent her to take care of the vineyards.
The damsel, however, consoled her beloved and herself with the assurance that, though
separated bodily, indissoluble ties subsisted between them, over which her brothers
had no control. She requested him to meet her in the evening, and as he did not come,
she feared that some accident had befallen him on the way, and went in search of him,
and found him. The evening now was the only time in which they could enjoy each other’s
company, as, during the day, the damsel was occupied in the vineyards. On one occasion,
when entering a garden, she accidentally came in the presence of King Solomon, who
happened to be on a summer visit to that neighbourhood. Struck with the beauty of
the damsel, the King conducted her into his royal tent, and there, assisted by his
court-ladies, endeavoured with alluring flatteries and promises, to gain her affections;
but without effect. Released from the King’s presence, the damsel soon sought an interview
with her beloved shepherd.
</p>
<p>The King, however, took her with him to his capital in great pomp, in the hope of
dazzling her with his splendour; but neither did this prevail: for while even there,
she told her beloved shepherd, who had followed her into the capital, and obtained
an interview with her, that she was anxious to quit the gaudy scene for her own home.
The shepherd, on hearing this, praised her constancy, and such a manifestation <span class="pageNum" id="pb6">[<a href="#pb6">6</a>]</span>of their mutual attachment took place, that several of the court-ladies were greatly
affected by it.
</p>
<p>The King, still determined, if possible, to win her affections, watched for another
favourable opportunity, and with flatteries and allurements, surpassing all that he
had used before, tried to obtain his purpose. He promised to elevate her to the highest
rank, and to raise her above all his concubines and queens, if she would comply with
his wishes; but, faithful to her espousals, she refused all his overtures, on the
plea that her affections were pledged to another. The King, convinced at last that
he could not possibly prevail, was obliged to dismiss her; and the shepherdess, in
company with her beloved shepherd, returned to her native place. On their way home,
they visited the tree under which they had first met, and there renewed their vows
of fidelity to each other. On her arrival in safety at her home, her brothers, according
to their promise, rewarded her greatly for her virtuous conduct.
</p>
<p>The <i>plot</i>, if such it may be called, gradually develops itself, like most poetic narratives
of a similar kind. Various speakers are introduced in the poem, as the Shulamite shepherdess,
the shepherd, the King, the court-ladies, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the brothers
of the Shulamite, and the companions of the shepherd, all of whom are represented
as speaking more or less, but without any such distinctions as we find in Job, as
“After this <i>Job</i> opened his mouth and cursed his day—Then <i>Eliphaz</i> the Temanite answered and said—Then answered <i>Bildad</i> the Shuhite and said—&amp;c.,” and without <i>separate</i> names, or <i>initial</i> letters of names to indicate the speakers, which renders it difficult to gather the
history it contains; and especially as some of the statements appear at first sight
to have little or no logical sequence. The Song of Songs differs materially in this
respect from all the other books of Scripture; but not, as is well known, from the
poems of profane writers.
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the aforementioned difficulty, an attentive <span class="pageNum" id="pb7">[<a href="#pb7">7</a>]</span>reader of the original will find nearly as much help from the masterly structure of
this Song, as can be obtained from the divisions and initial letters in modern dramas,
by which the different speakers are distinguished, and the various statements are
connected in a regular narrative.
</p>
<p>The recurrence, for instance, of the same formula of adjuration three times (ii. 7;
iii. 5; viii. 4), and the use of another closing sentence (v. 1), divide the Song
into five sections. The heroine of the book, when speaking with her beloved or with
the king, is easily distinguished by the feminine gender of the verb, or of the adjective
or the noun; as, i. 5, “I am swarthy but comely,” where both adjectives, <i>swarthy</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שְׁחוֹרָה‎</span>) and <i>comely</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נָאוָה‎</span>), are feminine in the original, and plainly indicate the speaker. The beloved shepherd,
when he speaks, or is spoken to, or is spoken of, is recognised by the pastoral language
(i. 3, 4, 7; ii. 12; iii. 4, &amp;c.); the King is distinguished by express allusions
to his position (i. 9–11; vi. 4–vii. 10); the court-ladies, when speaking to the Shulamite,
are recognised by the phrase, “fairest of women” (i. 8; v. 9; vi. 1), and when spoken
to by “daughters of Jerusalem” (i. 5; ii. 7; iii. 5, 10; v. 8; viii. 4); the brothers
of the Shulamite are introduced as speaking in ii. 15, compared with i. 6 and viii.
8, 9; the inhabitants of Jerusalem, in iii. 6–11, and the companions of the shepherd,
in viii. 5, are sufficiently indicated by the context.
</p>
<p>On a careful examination of the statements of the various speakers in these five sections,
it will be found that the narrative, though not recorded in the order we have stated,
may be easily deduced from it.
</p>
<p>In the <span class="asc">FIRST</span> section—ch. i. 2, 7—the heroine of the Song, who, as is evident from verse 8 and
vii. 1, is a Shulamite shepherdess, ardently wishes for the presence and love-tokens
of her beloved, who, as she herself most distinctly tells us (ver. 7, and ii. 16;
vi. 3), is a shepherd; she wishes him to take her away from the royal apartments into
which the King had brought her, for she loves him above all things (verses 2, 3, 4);
<span class="pageNum" id="pb8">[<a href="#pb8">8</a>]</span>these apartments (or royal tent), as we learn from iii. 6–11, were out of Jerusalem,
and in the neighbourhood of the Shulamite’s home, where the King temporarily resided,
and where he met with the damsel (vi. 11, 12). In reply to the disdainful looks of
the daughters of Jerusalem, in whose presence she had expressed her desire for the
shepherd, and who had contrasted their fair and delicate countenances with her own,
she insists that her swarthy complexion need not render her contemptible, for it was
not natural, but had arisen from the duties which her brothers had unjustly required
of her (v. 6); she then resumes the address to her beloved, asking him, as if he were
present, to tell her where he tends his flock (7). The daughters of Jerusalem, who,
as we see from vi. 9, are the court-ladies, comprising the maidens, concubines, and
queens, ironically answer this question (8). The watchful King, having heard that
she wished for her beloved, immediately comes forward, and, with flatteries and promises,
tries to win her affections (9, 10, 11); but without effect; for as soon as the King
retires she shows her unabated attachment to her shepherd (12; ii. 6), and concludes
by adjuring the court-ladies not to persuade her to transfer her affections to another
(7).
</p>
<p>The <span class="asc">SECOND</span> section—ch. ii. 8; iii. 5—though apparently disconnected from the first, is found,
upon investigation, to be a proper and natural sequence. The Shulamite, in rebutting
the contempt of the court-ladies, had reflected with some severity upon her brothers
for sending her to keep the vineyards; but this had been done merely to account for
the darkness of her complexion; and having been interrupted in her warm address to
her beloved, which she hastened to resume, she was obliged to be satisfied with this
passing allusion to that event. It was natural, therefore, to expect that, at the
first opportunity, she would state more circumstantially <i>how</i> her brothers came to be severe with her, and <i>why</i> they had made her a keeper of the vineyards, which she proceeds to do in this section.
She tells the court-ladies that her brothers were displeased with her <span class="pageNum" id="pb9">[<a href="#pb9">9</a>]</span>because they had overheard the shepherd inviting her to accompany him into the fields
to enjoy together the charms of nature (8–14), on account of which, in their anxiety
for her reputation, they changed her employment, told her to be a “keeper of the vineyards,”
in order to separate her from her beloved (15). She, moreover, relates that they consoled
themselves with the assurance that, though separated bodily, indissoluble ties subsisted
between them, over which her brothers had no control (16); that she invited him to
come again in the evening, when unobserved (17); and that, seeing he did not come,
she went in search of him, &amp;c. (ch. iii. 1–4). Having thus evinced her deep attachment
for the shepherd, she again concludes by adjuring the court-ladies not to persuade
her to transfer her affections to another (5).
</p>
<p>This section, therefore, follows the preceding one, to set forth the cause of the
brother’s severity in having made her a “keeper of the vineyards,” and thus gives
a further insight into her previous history.
</p>
<p>The <span class="asc">THIRD</span> section (ch. iii. 6, v. i.) relates the second unsuccessful effort of Solomon to
gain the Shulamite’s affections. The King, determined to gain his purpose, takes the
damsel, with great pomp, into the capital (ch. iii. 6–11), in the hope of dazzling
her with his great splendour; but he is again disappointed. In the midst of the imposing
magnificence, the damsel tells her beloved shepherd, who has followed her thither,
and obtained an interview with her, and expressed his delight at seeing her again
(ch. iv. 1–5), that she is anxious to quit the palace for her rural home (6). Her
beloved, on hearing this, offers his assistance to effect an escape (7, 8), and praises
her constancy and charms (9–16); whereupon they both manifest their mutual attachment
in so affecting a manner that even some of the court-ladies are moved (ch. iv. 16,
v. 1), with whose expression of sympathy the section concludes.
</p>
<p>The bearing which this section has upon the whole plan is, in the first place, to
develop the progress of the history itself, <span class="pageNum" id="pb10">[<a href="#pb10">10</a>]</span>inasmuch as it records the conveyance of the Shulamite from her rural home into the
royal capital; and, in the second place, to relate her faithfulness in resisting another
temptation, in which the grandeur of the procession which elicited so much admiration
from the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the splendour of the court, which dazzled the
eyes and fed the vanity of so many of its inmates, had far less charms for her than
the presence of her shepherd in a humble home.
</p>
<p>The <span class="asc">FOURTH</span> section (ch. v. 2–viii. 4) records the last and greatest trial which the Shulamite
had to encounter, and which she also overcame. It commences with a dream which she
had recently had, and which she relates (ch. v. 2–8) to the court-ladies whose sympathy
with her has been shown at the close of the preceding section. The narration of this
dream gives the damsel an opportunity of describing the personal appearance of her
beloved (10–16), and thus we are gradually led on to her chief trial and success.
The court-ladies, having listened to this charming description, inquire whither her
beloved is gone, and offer their assistance to seek him (ch. vi. 1); but she, suspecting
the motive, gives them an evasive answer (2, 3). The King, ever watchful for a favourable
opportunity to show his attachment to her, as soon as he hears of the inquiry after
the damsel’s beloved, comes forward with most alluring flatteries and promises. He
begins with praising her beauty (4–7), and then promises to raise her to the highest
rank of all his numerous retinue of women (8, 9), who themselves are constrained to
extol her beauty (10). But the damsel, having explained how she came to be seen by
those court-ladies, spurns all those praises and promises, and goes away (11, 12);
the King calls her back (ch. vii. 1), and, having again described her beauty and attractions
(2–8), wishes that he might enjoy the favours of so charming a person (9, 10); but
she refuses the King’s overtures, on the plea that her affections are engaged, and
that it is her duty to be faithful to her beloved (11); then, addressing herself to
her beloved, she asks him to go with her <span class="pageNum" id="pb11">[<a href="#pb11">11</a>]</span>from the palace to their rural home (12, ch. viii. 3); and concludes with again adjuring
the court-ladies not to persuade her to transfer her affections to another (4).
</p>
<p>This section, as we have seen, is intimately connected with the preceding one. The
damsel, having obtained the sympathies of some of the court-ladies, according to the
close of the last section, relates to them, at the opening of this (ch. v. 2–8), a
dream which she had recently had; which gives the damsel an opportunity of describing
the appearance of her beloved, and this description gradually introduces the last
and the greatest trial which she has to encounter.
</p>
<p>The <span class="asc">FIFTH</span> section—ch. viii. 5–14—states the result of the damsel’s victory over all her temptations.
The King, convinced that nothing could induce her to transfer her affections, dismisses
her; and accompanied by her beloved shepherd, she quits the court for her humble country
residence. On their way, they visit the tree under which they were first espoused
(viii. 5), and there implore that the flame which had been kindled in their hearts
might be lasting. A most graphic and powerful description of the nature of true love
follows, in which all her trials are recounted (6, 7). The damsel then reminds her
brothers of the promise they had made her, and obtains <i>the reward of virtue</i>.
</p>
<p>Thus this Song records the real history of a humble but virtuous woman, who, after
having been espoused to a man of like humble circumstances, had been tempted in a
most alluring manner to abandon him, and to transfer her affections to one of the
wisest, and richest of men, but who successfully resisted all temptations, remained
faithful to her espousals, and was ultimately rewarded for her virtue.

<h3 class="main">SECTION IV.—IMPORTANCE OF THE BOOK.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Few, it is presumed, will question the importance of a Book, in the sacred canon,
which records an example of virtue in a humble individual, who had passed successfully
through unparalleled temptations.
</p>
<p>The avowed object of Holy Writ is to teach all that is good and conducive to human
happiness. Lessons of wisdom and virtue are interspersed throughout the Old and New
Testaments. The Apostle Paul urges the Philippians to think of whatsoever is true,
noble, just, pure, lovely, and of good report: of everything, in short, that is in
any way profitable or praiseworthy. These lessons are not communicated to us in abstract
forms, or enforced by powerful argument merely, but they are presented in the most
attractive examples drawn from the lives of illustrious men and women, who, amidst
the greatest trials and temptations, have pre-eminently maintained their integrity.
The Patriarch Job is set forth as an example of patience, and the Prophets as patterns
of suffering affliction (James v. 10, 11). An example of virtue, very similar to the
one in the Song before us, is recorded in Gen. xxxix. 7, &amp;c., where a Hebrew slave
is tempted by a woman of rank, but resists the temptations; and though left to suffer
for a season, is ultimately rewarded for his virtue. Such instances, therefore, are
in harmony with the design of Scripture, and its method of teaching.
</p>
<p>The individual who passes through the extraordinary temptations recorded in this Song,
and remains faithful, is <i>a woman</i>. Who can find a virtuous woman? This was the question of the Ancients, was reiterated
in the middle ages, and is still asked by many. Here is a reply to Solomon’s own enquiry.
He has found one at least of spotless integrity, and her virtue is recorded in Scripture,
for the defence of women against a prevalent, but unjust suspicion.
</p>
<p>The second chapter of Genesis clearly states, that the man and the woman were created
with the same intellectual and <span class="pageNum" id="pb13">[<a href="#pb13">13</a>]</span>moral powers. The words used by God respecting the creation of the woman are, “the
being of man in his solitary state is not good. I will make him <i>a help-mate corresponding to him</i>;” that is, one that shall be exactly like him in affections, in sympathies, in mind,
in fact his counterpart; she shall be the reflection of his own person. That this
is the meaning of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כְּנֶנְדּוֹ‎</span> is evident from the Septuagint, which renders it in verse 18, <span class="trans" title="kat’ auton"><span lang="grc" class="grek">κατ’ αὐτόν</span></span>, and verse 20, <span class="trans" title="homoios autō"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ὅμοιος αὐτῷ</span></span>; and from the Syriac and the Vulgate; as well as from the Rabbinical usage of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כְּנֶנֶד‎</span>, to express things <i>exactly like one another</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e675src" href="#xd31e675">5</a> The word of God affirms here, that the woman was created exactly with the same capacities
as the man, and contains no intimation of subserviency to him, or of being in the
slightest degree weaker or less virtuous than he. The fact that the Tempter assailed
the woman, and not the man, so far from showing that the woman was weaker, would rather
prove that she was stronger; that the cunning serpent knew this, and was persuaded,
if he could only prevail over the woman, she, with her superior influence, would be
sure to succeed with the man, as the sad result showed.
</p>
<p>The curse which God pronounced upon the guilty pair, proves that the woman was created
with the same intellectual and moral capacities as the man. Had the woman been weaker
in these respects than the man, she would not have been accountable in an equal degree
for her sin, and would not have been punished with the same severity.
</p>
<p>No alteration has taken place in their relative position, in this respect, since the
fall. The curse upon the woman in relation to the man does not refer to any <i>intellectual</i> or <i>moral</i>, but to a <i>physical</i>, inferiority. Hitherto the Protoplasts resided in Paradise, and subsisted upon its
delightful fruit; and the employment of the man was mere recreation. Henceforth they
were to be driven from that happy abode; the woman was to experience all the sorrow
and pain of <span class="pageNum" id="pb14">[<a href="#pb14">14</a>]</span>pregnancy and parturition, and must look to her husband for support from his hard-earned
labour. The man, consigned to rough labour in the field, exposed to the assault of
brutes, was henceforth to have more physical strength and daring; while the woman,
destined to manage the affairs at home, and to rear up a family, was to exercise the
power of patient endurance. The man, with his superior strength and boldness, was
henceforth to be the protector; the woman, suffering and mild, the protected. He was
to be the tiller of the ground, and she, in addition to the sorrow peculiar to her
condition, must depend on what he might provide for her; and hence her desire was
to be unto him; that is, she should be looking up to him for protection and maintenance,
<span class="corr" id="xd31e689" title="Source: aud">and</span> thus he would rule over her. That this is the whole meaning of the phrase <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏וְאֶל אִישֵׁדְ תְּשׁוּקָתֵדְ וְהוּא יִמְשָׁל בָּדְ‎</span>, Gen. iii. 16, is evident from the clause immediately preceding, which describes
the woman’s constant suffering, and precludes the possibility of securing maintenance
for herself; and also from the following verse, where the man is destined to labour
hard for bread.
</p>
<p>The notion, therefore, that the woman is intellectually or morally weaker than man,
is not the teaching of the word of God. While man, through his superior out-of-door
qualities, or physical strength and courage, is the supporter, protector, and ruler
of the woman; she, through her superior in-door qualities, her endurance and her charms,
ameliorates his government, and sways his inmost heart. Their different characteristics,
arising from their different destinations, were designed to blend together so as to
produce a happy harmony, and <i>to make both one</i>.
</p>
<p>But how vilely and treacherously has man employed his superior strength and audacity!
Instead of maintaining, protecting, and defending the woman, he has used his strength
to oppress, to crush, and to degrade her. As the human race became more and more alienated
from their Creator, intrinsic merit and moral character were despised, and physical
<span class="pageNum" id="pb15">[<a href="#pb15">15</a>]</span>force became rampant; the stronger, as among animals, oppressed and preyed upon the
weaker, and thus woman became the slave of man, and was absolutely sold in the capacity
of daughter or wife, as cattle and other property. Thus Eliezer, the servant of Abraham,
purchased Rebekah as a wife for Isaac, his master’s son, (Gen. xxiv. 53). Jacob, having
nothing to give as a compensation for his wives, was obliged to serve fourteen years
for them (Gen. xxix. 18–28). Shechem, wishing to obtain Dinah for a wife, and ascribing
the unwillingness of Jacob to part with her to the insufficiency of the compensation
he had offered, says—“Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according
as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife (Gen. xxxiv. 12).” Compare,
also, Exod. xxii. 15, &amp;c.; 1 Sam. xviii. 25; Hos. iii. 2. This custom of purchasing
wives was general among the Orientals. “In Babylon,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e704src" href="#xd31e704">6</a> the following course was pursued in every village once a-year. All the maidens of
a marriageable age were collected together, and brought in a body to one place; around
them stood a crowd of men. Then a crier, having made these maidens stand up one by
one, offered them for sale, beginning with the most beautiful; and when she had been
sold for a large sum, he put up another who was next in beauty. They were sold on
condition that they should be married. Such men among the Babylonians as were rich
and desirous of marrying used to bid against one another, and purchase the most beautiful.
But such of the lower classes as were desirous of marrying, did not regard beauty,
and were willing to take the plainer damsels with a sum of money given with them.
For when the crier had finished selling the most beautiful of the maidens, he made
the plainest stand up, or one that was a cripple, and put her up for auction, for
the person who would marry her for the least sum. This money was obtained from the
sale of the most beautiful; and thus the beautiful portioned out the plain and the
crippled.” Wives were purchased among the Assyrians and Arabians also;<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e707src" href="#xd31e707">7</a> among <span class="pageNum" id="pb16">[<a href="#pb16">16</a>]</span>the ancient Greeks<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e712src" href="#xd31e712">8</a> and Germans<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e716src" href="#xd31e716">9</a> and are still bought among the Orientals of the present day.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e719src" href="#xd31e719">10</a>
</p>
<p>Fearful consequences, arising from such a mode of obtaining wives, were inevitable,
and soon became apparent. As the procuring of wives depended upon the offer which
any one was able to make, those that could afford it purchased as many as they pleased.
Hence the practice of polygamy, than which nothing produces more contempt for the
proper character of women, or tends more to their degradation. As these contracts
were formed without the parties being previously known to each other, and without
any affection subsisting between them, the woman, instead of being <i>the help-mate or companion</i> of man became his slave, and was kept for the gratification of his carnal appetites,
or at best was regarded as a plaything for a leisure hour. Her rights were denied,
her education was neglected, her intellect was degraded, her moral character was questioned.
Man, seeking to possess as many wives as he could afford, gave the woman no credit
for virtue. Acting upon this suspicion and false accusation, he placed her in the
most inaccessible part of the house; dogs or eunuchs guarded the doors of her chambers;<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e726src" href="#xd31e726">11</a> the harem was made as impenetrable as a prison; none but the nearest relatives were
allowed to see her, and when permitted to pass through the streets her countenance
was thickly veiled, and eunuchs watched her every step. Plutarch relates that when
women travelled they were placed in a conveyance closely covered on all sides, and
that it was in such a covering that Themistocles fled from Persia, his attendants
being instructed to tell every inquirer that they were conveying a Grecian lady from
Ionia to a nobleman at Court.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e729src" href="#xd31e729">12</a> The sacred books of heathen nations <span class="pageNum" id="pb17">[<a href="#pb17">17</a>]</span>teem with loud execrations against the natural unfaithfulness and immorality of women.
“The lust of a woman,” says the pundits, “is never satisfied, no more than fire is
satisfied with fuel, or the main ocean with receiving the rivers, or the empire of
death with the dying of men and animals.” And again: “Women have six qualities: the
first is an immoderate desire for jewels and fine furniture, handsome clothes and
nice victuals; the second, immoderate lust; the third, violent anger; the fourth,
deep resentment, no person knowing the sentiments concealed in their hearts; the fifth,
another person’s good appears evil in their eyes; the sixth, they commit bad actions.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e734src" href="#xd31e734">13</a> The wickedness of women is a subject upon which the stronger sex among the Arabs,
with an affectation of superior virtue, often dwell in common conversation. That women
are deficient in judgment or good sense, is held as an undisputed fact, as it rests
on an assertion of the Prophet; but that they possess a superior degree of cunning,
rests upon the same authority. Their general depravity is affirmed to be much greater
than that of men. “I stood,” said the Prophet, “at the gate of Paradise, and lo, most
of its inmates were the poor; and I stood at the gate of hell, and lo, most of its
inmates were women.” In allusion to women, the caliph Omar said, “Consult them, and
do the contrary of what they advise,” which Moore has thus paraphrased:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Whene’er you’re in doubt, said a sage I once knew, </p>
<p class="line">’Twixt two lines of conduct which course to pursue, </p>
<p class="line">Ask a woman’s advice, and whate’er she advise, </p>
<p class="line">Do the very reverse, and you’re sure to be wise.” </p>
</div>
<p class="first">When woman was created, “the devil,” we are told, “was delighted, and said, ‘Thou
art half of my host, and thou art the depository of my secret, and thou art my arrow,
with which I shoot and miss not.’ ”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e745src" href="#xd31e745">14</a> They were made so much to feel their <span class="pageNum" id="pb18">[<a href="#pb18">18</a>]</span>inferiority, that Iphigenia is made to say, “One man, forsooth, is better than ten
thousand women.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e750src" href="#xd31e750">15</a>
</p>
<p>Though the Jewish women were treated more leniently, and enjoyed greater privileges
than their sex in other nations, yet it is evident, from a variety of circumstances
in Old Testament history, that they were not wholly emancipated from a state of unnatural
inferiority. Polygamy was practised amongst the Jews, and its debasing effects were
obvious. The harems, the veils, and eunuchs were not uncommon to their women. Weakness
of moral character was imputed to them; unfaithfulness and incontinency were dilated
upon (Num. v. 12; Prov. xxxi. 10; Eccl. vii. 28). Josephus tells us<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e755src" href="#xd31e755">16</a> that women, in consequence of their natural levity, were not admitted as legal witnesses
in courts of justice. Maimonides teaches the same; “There are,” says this great luminary,
“ten sorts of disqualifications, and every individual in whom one of them is found,
is disqualified from giving evidence; and these are women, slaves, children, idiots,
the deaf, the blind, the wicked, the despised, relations, and those interested in
their testimony; these are the ten.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e758src" href="#xd31e758">17</a> The Rabbins endeavour to justify this inhuman treatment of women from the law of
Moses. “Women,” say they, “are disqualified by the law from giving testimony: for
it is said, ‘At the mouth of two witnesses,’ where the word ‘witnesses’ is of the
<i>masculine</i>, and not feminine gender.” It is not to be wondered at, therefore, that the Jew,
among his thanksgivings, should say to the Almighty every morning, “Blessed be thou,
O Lord our God, King of the universe, that thou hast not created me <i>a woman</i>.”
</p>
<p>Now, if one sex of the human family has been so degraded by the other; if she whom
God created to be a <i>help-mate and counterpart</i> has been reduced by man to the slave of his carnal lusts; if such slavish and inhuman
treatment has been justified on the false plea of the natural unfaithfulness and incontinency
<span class="pageNum" id="pb19">[<a href="#pb19">19</a>]</span>of the sex; if exclusion from society and imprisonment have been deemed necessary
for the preservation of her morals, how greatly has woman been alienated from the
original design of her creation! how unjustly has her character been aspersed! how
inhumanly has she been treated! and how great is the importance of a book which celebrates
the virtuous example of a woman, and thus strikes at the root of all her reproaches
and her wrongs!
</p>
<p>The importance of this view of the book may be further seen from the fact, that, in
proportion to the degradation of women, men themselves have become degraded; for,
deprived of the meliorating influences which the delicacy and tenderness of women
were designed to have over them, and never more needed than in their fallen state,
they have abandoned themselves to their worst passions and desires, and thus their
whole civil and social condition has been proportionally undignified and unblest.
Look, on the other hand, at the state of society where woman is restored to her rightful
position, there we shall find refinement of manners, purity of conversation, mutual
confidence and affection, domestic happiness, intellectual enjoyment, freedom of thought
and action, sympathetic repose, and whatever, in fact, tends to mitigate the unavoidable
evils of the present life; all referable, in a greater or less degree, to the unrestricted
influence of woman upon the child and upon the man. In religion, her influence is
still more potent. If first in the transgression, she is first in the restoration;
and were man as ready to follow her in doing good as he has been in doing evil, the
world would long ago have been in a holier and happier state than it is at present.
Who constitute the principal part of our worshipping assemblies? Women. Who form the
chief portion of the members of our churches? Women. Who are the chief agents in the
religious education of our children? Women. Who are the main support of our various
benevolent and evangelical institutions? Women. Let it not be said, then, that a Book
which celebrates the ascendency <span class="pageNum" id="pb20">[<a href="#pb20">20</a>]</span>of a virtuous woman in humble life over all the blandishments of wealth and royalty,
is unworthy of a place in Holy Writ.
</p>
<p>The importance of this book is, moreover, enhanced by the circumstances more immediately
connected with the time in which it was written.
</p>
<p>The conduct of Bath-sheba with David was calculated to confirm man in his opinion
that woman was naturally unfaithful and incontinent, and that it was requisite to
exclude her from society, in order to preserve her morals. But the narrative here
recorded forms a contrast to the conduct of Bath-sheba. It shows the power of virtue
in a woman, even of humble life. As the wife of an officer of rank, accustomed to
luxury and wealth, the temptations of Bath-sheba were not so great, and yet she surrendered
to them. Whereas the Shulamite, a humble shepherdess, to whom the promise of costly
apparel and of elevation from a low and toilsome occupation to the highest rank, must
have been an extraordinary allurement, triumphed over them all. If one woman yielded
to small incitements, this book shows that another overcame unparalleled temptations,
and thus checked the clamour against woman which might have arisen from the conduct
of Bath-sheba with David.

<h3 class="main">SECTION V.—HISTORICAL SKETCH OF THE EXEGESIS OF THE BOOK.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">No book has furnished a wider field for the speculation and visionary projects of
those who substitute their own imagination and enthusiastic feelings for the teaching
of Scripture, than the Song of Solomon; the varieties and absurdities of which are
a solemn warning against departing from the rules of sound philology and critical
interpretation.
</p>
<p>An enumeration of all the different interpretations of this Song would be too lengthy,
and is not required. It will be sufficient to glance at the leading expositions. We
begin with the Jewish.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb21">[<a href="#pb21">21</a>]</span></p>
<p>323–246, <span class="asc">B.C.</span><a class="noteRef" id="xd31e787src" href="#xd31e787">18</a> It has been supposed that the Septuagint, which may be regarded as the oldest Jewish
exegetical tradition, contains some intimation that the translators of the Old Testament
into Greek and their Jewish brethren of those days must have interpreted the Song
of Solomon in an allegorical manner. The only passage adduced in corroboration of
this opinion is, Ch. iv. 8, where the Septuagint renders <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מֵראֹשׁ אֲמָנָה‎</span> <i>from the top of Amana</i>, by <span class="trans" title="apo archēs pisteōs"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ἀπὸ <span class="corr" id="xd31e808" title="Source: ἀρχῆ">ἀρχῆς</span> πίστεως</span></span>, <i>from the top of faith</i>. That this appeal is nugatory is obvious from the rendering of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תִּרְצָה‎</span> <i>Tirzah</i> by <span class="trans" title="eudokia"><span lang="grc" class="grek">εὐδοκία</span></span>, <i>delight</i>, vi. 4, and of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בַּתנָדִיב‎</span> <i>noble daughter</i> by <span class="trans" title="thygater Nadab"><span lang="grc" class="grek">θύγατερ Ναδάβ</span></span>, <i>daughter of Nadab</i>, vii. 1; whence it is evident that the Septuagint frequently mistook <i>proper names</i> for appellatives and adjectives, and <i>vice versâ</i>. It appears inconceivable that a profound scholar like Keil, who is well acquainted
with the frequent errors of the Septuagint, should quote this as a special and sufficient
proof that “the Alexandrian version took this Song in an allegorical sense,”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e858src" href="#xd31e858">19</a> especially as he knew that some have drawn from it the very opposite conclusion,
who have argued that if the authors of the Septuagint had understood this book in
any other than its obvious sense, they would have betrayed it in the translation.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e865src" href="#xd31e865">20</a>
</p>
<p>180, <span class="asc">B.C.</span> Jesus Sirach, xlvii. 14–17, is next adduced as furnishing some clue to the Jewish
interpretation of this book. Ecclesiasticus, according to some, is a name given to
it <span class="trans" title="kat’ exochēn"><span lang="grc" class="grek">κατ’ ἐξοχὴν</span></span>, because of its being the most remarkable and useful of the ecclesiastical or apocryphal
books; others say it was so called from its resemblance to Solomon’s <i>Ecclesiastes</i>, and others, again, with more probability, that this name was given to it by the
Latins, to denote <i>its use in the church</i>. Its Greek name, however, <span class="trans" title="Sophia Iēsou huiou Seirach"><span lang="grc" class="grek">Σοφία Ἰησοῦ υἱοῦ Σειράχ</span></span>, <i>wisdom of Jesus <span class="pageNum" id="pb22">[<a href="#pb22">22</a>]</span>son of Sirach</i>, is more appropriate. It specifies at once the author, who mentions his own name
in Ch. l. 27. The age given to the book here, is that which is thought most probable.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e902src" href="#xd31e902">21</a> This apocryphal writer says in his apostrophe to Solomon,—“<i>How wise wast thou in thy youth, and, as a flood, filled with understanding! Thy mind
covered the earth, and thou filledst it with enigmatic sayings. Thy name went forth
to the distant isles, and thou wast beloved for thy peace. Countries admired thee
for songs, and proverbs, and enigmas, and solutions.</i>” The 17th verse is supposed to include the whole writings of Solomon contained in
the Old Testament; and it is affirmed that <span class="trans" title="parabolai ainigmatōn"><span lang="grc" class="grek">παραβολαὶ αἰνιγμάτων</span></span> in verse 15, cannot be understood to mean the Proverbs (<span class="trans" title="paroimia"><span lang="grc" class="grek">παροιμία</span></span>) since these are separately mentioned in verse 17, hence it follows that they refer
to the allegorical interpretation of this Song.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e926src" href="#xd31e926">22</a>
</p>
<p>Even Hengstenberg, who, though a defender of the allegorical interpretation, remarks,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e931src" href="#xd31e931">23</a> “Sirach xlvii. 17, has wrongly been referred to in support of the allegorical interpretation.
For the words <span class="trans" title="en ōdais kai paroimiais kai parabolais kai en hermēneiais apethaumasan se chōrai"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ἐν ᾠδαῖς καὶ παροίμιαις καὶ παραβολαῖς καὶ ἐν ἑρμηνείαις ἀπεθαύμασάν σε χῶραι</span></span> depend upon the historical narration in the Books of the Kings, and do not refer
to the writings comprised in the Canon. This is evident from the mention of the <span class="trans" title="hermēneiai"><span lang="grc" class="grek"><span class="corr" id="xd31e945" title="Source: ἑρμηνειαι">ἑρμηνείαι</span></span></span>, whereby <i>the solutions</i> of the enigmas in contradistinction to the enigmas themselves, can alone be meant.
Comp. 1 Kings x. 1–3. Whereas in the Canon no such <span class="trans" title="hermēneiai"><span lang="grc" class="grek"><span class="corr" id="xd31e959" title="Source: ἑρμηνειαι">ἑρμηνείαι</span></span></span> are to be found. Verse 15, in which Keil finds a special reference to the allegorical
interpretation, likewise alludes to 1 Kings x., especially to verse 24.”
</p>
<p>120, <span class="asc">B.C.</span> The Book of Wisdom has also been supposed to contain a clue to the interpretation
of this Song. The author and the age of the Book are points of great contest. <span class="pageNum" id="pb23">[<a href="#pb23">23</a>]</span>All that can be concluded with any degree of probability is, that the author was an
Alexandrian Jew, who lived after the transplanting of the Greek philosophy into Egypt,
and that he seems to refer to the oppression of the later Ptolemies.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e975src" href="#xd31e975">24</a> In ch. viii. 2, Solomon is represented as speaking to Wisdom; “<i>Her I loved and sought from my youth, I sought to bring her home for my bride, and
I became a lover of her beauty.</i>” Because Solomon is here made to speak of Wisdom as his bride, it has been maintained
to be an explanation of the Song of Songs, as though the brides were necessarily the
same.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e985src" href="#xd31e985">25</a> Let any impartial reader peruse the description of Wisdom in the chapter quoted,
and that of the bride in the Song of Songs, and he will be convinced that there is
no intentional resemblance whatever.
</p>
<p>37–95<span class="corr" id="xd31e993" title="Source: .">,</span> <span class="asc">A.D.</span> Josephus is also said to have understood this Song in an allegorical sense, although
it is not in a single instance quoted by him. His arrangement of the Books of the
Old Testament is the only ground of this argument. It is said, as he<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e999src" href="#xd31e999">26</a> mentions twenty-two books which are justly accredited as Divine, (<span class="trans" title="ta dikaiōs theia pepisteumena"><span lang="grc" class="grek">τὰ δικαίως θεῖα πεπιστευμένα</span></span>) and describes five as belonging to Moses, thirteen to the Prophets, and the remaining
four as containing hymns to God, and rules of life for men (<span class="trans" title="hai de loipai tessares hymnous eis ton Theon kai tois anthrōpois hypothēkas tou biou periechousin"><span lang="grc" class="grek">αἱ δὲ λοιπαὶ τέσσαρες ὕμνους εἰς τὸν Θεὸν καὶ τοῖς ἀνθρώποις ὑποθήκας τοῦ βίου περιέχουσιν</span></span>) <i>viz.</i>, the Psalms, Job, Proverbs, and Ecclesiastes, no place is left for this Song except
among the Prophets; and if Josephus placed it there, it follows that he must have
understood it allegorically.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1021src" href="#xd31e1021">27</a> But were we to admit that Josephus placed this Song among the prophetical writings,
we should deny the conclusion attempted to be drawn from it. For according to the
same mode of argumentation, we might infer that Josephus understood <span class="pageNum" id="pb24">[<a href="#pb24">24</a>]</span>Ruth and Esther allegorically, for he also places these books among the prophetical
writings. The fact is, that this historian, as he tells us himself, reckons the historical
books among the prophetical ones. But we demur to the assertion that Josephus put
this Song among the prophetical writings; it is far more likely that he placed it
among the four books which he describes as consisting of hymns to God and precepts
for the life of men.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1026src" href="#xd31e1026">28</a>
</p>
<p>We come now to the Talmud, in which passages from this Song are quoted and interpreted.
This elaborate work, consists of what is called the <i>Mishna</i>, constituting the text, and the <i>Gemara</i>, which is a commentary upon it, derived from two sources, <i>viz.</i>—Jerusalem and Babylon. The Jews, from time immemorial, had an <i>unwritten</i> law <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תּוֹרָה שֶׁבַּעַל פֶּה‎</span> <span class="trans" title="dogmata agrapha"><span lang="grc" class="grek">δόγματα ἄγραφα</span></span>, in addition to the <i>written</i> one, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תּוֹרָה שֶׁבַּכְּתָב‎</span>, <span class="trans" title="engraphos"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ἔγγραφος</span></span>, contained in the Pentateuch. Hillel of Babylon (born 75 <span class="asc">B.C.</span>), who, next to Ezra, was celebrated by posterity as the restorer of the law,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1067src" href="#xd31e1067">29</a> first arranged and divided this oral law into six parts:—1, concerning sowing; 2,
women; 3, festivals; 4, the rights of property; 5, holy things; 6, pure and impure
things. This, which comprises everything that appertains to the Jewish law, was called
<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מִשְׁנָה‎</span> <i>Mishna</i>, <span class="trans" title="deuterōsis"><span lang="grc" class="grek">δευτέρωσις</span></span>, or the second recension of the law. In order to reconcile the Sadducees, who denied
every law not founded on Holy Writ, Hillel laid down seven hermeneutic rules, whereby
the Scriptures might be interpreted in such a manner that the oral law could be deduced
from it.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1084src" href="#xd31e1084">30</a> When fears were afterwards entertained lest the oral tradition should be lost, Rabbi
Judah Hakkadosh (<i>i.e.</i> holy), in the year 220 <span class="asc">A.D.</span>, collected everything that had been said upon the subject, preserving the division
of Hillel, and probably making some additions of his <span class="pageNum" id="pb25">[<a href="#pb25">25</a>]</span>own. This he did in a manner so masterly and satisfactory, that it superseded every
other previous attempt, and constitutes the present <i>Mishna</i>.
</p>
<p>The <i>Mishna</i> became the chief object of study. The rules of Hillel were increased and much acted
on; expositions were given upon the reasons that led to the decisions in the Mishna;
the expounders were called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֲמוֹרָאִים‎</span> <i>Amoraim</i>, <i>public lecturers</i>, and the exposition <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גְמָרָא‎</span> <i>Gemara</i>.
</p>
<p>After the death of Judah, many of his learned disciples, objecting to the appointment
of his second son Gamaliel, to his father’s office, emigrated to Babylon, and having
erected schools there, pursued the study of the Mishna. The academy they established
in Sura rivalled the one in Tiberias. The Gemara of Tiberias, collated about 358 (<span class="asc">A.D.</span>) by an unknown individual, is called <i>Talmud Jerushalmi</i>; and the Gemara of Sura, the compilation of which was begun by R. Ashe (352–427),
continued by his disciple and friend, Rabina, and finished about 525, is called <i>Talmud Babli</i>. The latter surpasses the former in comprehensiveness, perspicuity, and depth, is
about four times as large, and fills 2947 folio pages. Both united are called <i>The Talmud</i> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תַּלְמוּד‎</span> <i>book of instruction</i>; and also <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גְמָרָא‎</span> <i>Gemara</i>. It contains the civil and ceremonial law, debates on various branches of art and
science, moral sayings, anecdotes, expositions on different passages of Scripture,
&amp;c.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1142src" href="#xd31e1142">31</a>
</p>
<p>100–500, <span class="asc">A.D.</span>—In Yadaim, (Sect. iii. 5.) we find that R. Akiba, one of the greatest Rabbins who
lived in the first century, and president of the Academy of Bai-Barc, said, “<i>The whole world was not worthy of the day in which this sublime Song was given to
Israel; for all the Scriptures are holy, but this sublime Song is most holy.</i>” There can, therefore, be no doubt that the mysteries which this distinguished Rabbi
found in the Song of Songs, he regarded as greater than those he discovered in any
other portion of the Sacred Scriptures.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb26">[<a href="#pb26">26</a>]</span></p>
<p>Subsequent Rabbins quote and explain different passages. Thus, Ch. i. 2 is discussed
in Abodah Sarah (Sect. 2, p. 35). It is asked, “<i>How are the words, ‘Thy love is better than wine’ understood?</i>” Answer: <i>When Rabbi Dimi came to Babylon, he said, “This verse is thus understood: the Congregation
of Israel said to God, ‘Lord of the Universe, the words of thy friends (namely, the
sages) are more excellent than even the wine of the Law.’</i>”
</p>
<p>Here we see that the beloved is taken to be <i>God</i>, and the loved one <i>the Congregation of Israel</i>.
</p>
<p>Ch. i. 3, is quoted and expounded, a little further on, in the same tract of the Talmud,
in the following manner. “<i>R. Nachman ben R. Chasdah once said, in his discourse, the words ‘Delicious is the
odour of thy perfumes,’ denote a learned man; for such an one is like a box of perfumes;
if it is covered up, no one can smell the perfumes, but when it is opened the odour
becomes widely diffused. It is so with a learned man without disciples, no one knows
of his learning; but if he gets a circle of disciples his name and his learning become
widely diffused. And not only this, but he himself will increase learning by teaching,
so that things which he formerly did not understand will now become plain to him;
for it is written in the same verse</i> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עלמות אהבוך‎</span> <span class="asc">DAMSELS LOVE THEE</span>; <i>read</i> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עלומות‎</span> <span class="asc">HIDDEN THINGS</span> <i>will love thee</i>, i.e., <i>will become plain to thee; and not only this, but even the angel of death will love
him; read then</i> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏על־מות‎</span> <span class="asc">HE WHO IS OVER DEATH</span> <i>will love thee; and still more, he will inherit both worlds, this world and the world
to come; read also</i> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עולמות‎</span> <span class="asc">WORLDS</span> <i>love thee.</i>”
</p>
<p>Ch. i. 13, 14, and v. 13, are quoted and explained in Sabbath, p. 88, b., “<i>Rabbi Joshuah ben Levi saith, What is meant by</i> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צרור המור דודי לי בין שדי ילין‎</span> <i>is the congregation of Israel, who is saying before the Holy One thus: O Lord, though
my beloved (i.e. God) oppresses me, and is embittered against me, yet he still lodges
with me.</i> By <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אשכול הכופר דודי לי בכרמי עין גדי‎</span> <i>is meant, He who is the owner of all things, will forgive me the <span class="pageNum" id="pb27">[<a href="#pb27">27</a>]</span>sin of the calf, with which I covered myself.</i> A question is raised, <i>How does</i> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בכרמי‎</span> <i>signify my covering?</i> Then Rabbi Mar-Sutra ben Rabbi Nachman quotes <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כסא של כובס שכורמי עליו את הכלאם‎</span> from another part of the Talmud (Kelim 35), where <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כרם‎</span> means <i>to cover</i>. R. Joshuah ben Levi proceeds, <i>What is meant by</i> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לחייו כערוגת הבושם‎</span> <i>is, At every commandment which proceedeth from the mouth of the Holy One on Mount
Sinai, the world was filled with aromatics.</i> A question is asked, <i>If the world was filled at the first commandment, where was the odour diffused at
the second commandment?</i> Answer, <i>The Holy One sent his wind from his stores, and carried them away successively, as
it is written</i>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שפתותיו שושנים‎</span> <i>do not read</i> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שושנים‎</span> <i>but</i> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ששונים‎</span> <i>repeating in succession.</i> Rabbi Joshuah ben Levi concludes, <i>At every commandment uttered by the mouth of the Holy One, the soul of Israel was
drawn out of them, as it is written, ‘My soul went out when he spake.’</i> A question is again asked, <i>If their soul was drawn out at the first commandment, how could they receive the second?</i> Answer. <i>He (i.e. God) caused the dew to come down, by which he will raise the dead, and revived
them, as it is written, ‘Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, whereby thou didst
confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary.’</i>” Ps. lxviii. 9.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1274src" href="#xd31e1274">32</a>
</p>
<p>Here, again, we see that the bridegroom is taken to be the Holy One, the Owner of
all things, and the bride the congregation of Israel. The reader, looking into the
text of the Talmud quoted in the note, will observe that most of this interpretation
has been obtained, either by the separation of words, the transposition and change
of letters, or by substituting <span class="pageNum" id="pb28">[<a href="#pb28">28</a>]</span>in the commentary words, similar in sound to those in the Scriptures. Thus, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צרור‎</span> <i>a bundle, a bag</i>, is explained by <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מיצר‎</span> <i>oppress</i>; <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מור‎</span> <i>myrrh</i> by <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מימר‎</span> <i>embitter</i>; <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אשכול‎</span> <i>a cluster</i> by <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏איש שהכל לו‎</span> <i>He whose are all things</i>; <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כופר‎</span> <i>cypress flowers</i> by <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כפר‎</span> <i>pardon</i>; <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עין גדי‎</span> <i>En-gedi</i> by <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עון עגל‎</span> <i>the sin of the calf</i>.
</p>
<p>This mode of interpretation is not confined to the Song of Songs, but is applied to
all parts of the Bible, and is an illustration of the way in which the hermeneutic
rules laid down by Rabbi Hillel, and augmented by R. Ishmael, and others, were carried
out.
</p>
<p>550, <span class="asc">A.D.</span>—The Targum or Chaldee paraphrase is the first entire commentary upon the Song of
Songs which has been handed down to us. The author is unknown. Kitto erroneously affirms,
that it was “made several centuries before the time of Christ, and probably before
the traditionary interpretation of the author himself (<i>i.e.</i> the author of this Song) would entirely be lost.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1343src" href="#xd31e1343">33</a> The inferior style in which it is written, the copious use it makes of legends of
a very late date, and especially the mention it makes of the <i>Gemara</i> (Ch. i. 2), which was not completed till nearly the middle of <i>the sixth century</i>, prove most distinctly that this paraphrase was made in the sixth century. Hävernick,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1351src" href="#xd31e1351">34</a> however, is equally wrong in affirming that the Mahomedans are mentioned in Ch. i.
7. That <i>the sons of Ishmael</i> here alluded to are not the Mahomedans, is evident from Ch. vi. 7. of the same paraphrase,
where we are told that these <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בְּנוֹי דְיִשְׁמָעֵאל‎</span> headed by Alexander the Great, came to wage war against Jerusalem at the time of
the Maccabees.
</p>
<p>The Targum takes the Song of Songs as an allegory, describing prophetically the history
of the Jewish nation, beginning with their Exodus from Egypt, and detailing their
doings and sufferings, down to the coming of the Messiah, and the building of the
third Temple.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb29">[<a href="#pb29">29</a>]</span></p>
<p>Thus, according to this allegory, Ch. i. 3, describes Jehovah’s fame, which went abroad
in consequence of the wonders he wrought when bringing the Israelites out of Egypt;
verse 12 describes the departure of Moses to receive the two tables of stone, and
how the Israelites, in the mean time, made the golden calf; verse 14 describes the
pardon of that sin, and the erection of the Tabernacle; Ch. iii. 6–11, describes the
passage of the Israelites, under the leadership of Joshua, over the Jordan, their
attacking and conquering the Canaanites, and the building of Solomon’s Temple; Ch.
v. 2, describes the Babylonian captivity; Ch. vi. 2, the deliverance of Israel through
Cyrus; and the building of the second Temple; Ch. vi. 7, &amp;c., describes the battles
of the Maccabees; Ch. vii. 11, 12, the present dispersion of the Jews, and their future
anxiety to learn the time of their restoration; Ch. viii. 5, &amp;c., describes the resurrection
of the dead, the final ingathering of Israel, the building of the third Temple, &amp;c.,
&amp;c.
</p>
<p>“The beloved,” according to the Targum, is <i>the Lord</i>; “the loved one” is <i>the Congregation of Israel</i>; “the companions of the beloved” (Ch. i. 7) are <i>the Edomites and the Ishmaelites</i>; “the daughters of Jerusalem” are, in Ch. i. 5, <i>the Gentile nations</i>; in ii. 7, iii. 5, viii. 4, <i>the Congregation of Israel</i>; and in v. 8<span class="corr" id="xd31e1376" title="Source: .">,</span> <i>the prophets</i>; “the brothers of the loved one” are <i>the false prophets</i>; “the little sister,” in viii. 8, is <i>the people of Israel</i>; the speakers in the same verse are <i>the angels</i>; the speaker in viii. 13, is <i>the Lord</i>; “the companions,” in the same verse are <i>the Sanhedrim</i>.
</p>
<p>The following specimen of the Targum, on the first chapter of this Song, will give
the reader an idea of the way in which the paraphrase develops the allegorical construction
of this book.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first"><a href="#v1.1">1</a>. <i>The Song of Songs, &amp;c.</i>—The songs and praises which Solomon the prophet, King of Israel, sang, by the spirit
of prophecy, before God, the Lord of the whole world. Ten songs were <span class="corr" id="xd31e1402" title="Source: sang">sung</span> in this world, but this song is the most celebrated of them all. The <i>first</i> song Adam sang when his sins were forgiven him, and when the sabbath-day came, and
protected him, he opened his mouth and said, “A song for the sabbath-day,<span class="corr" id="xd31e1407" title="Not in source">”</span> &amp;c. (Ps. xcii.) The <i>second</i> song Moses and the children of Israel sang when the <span class="pageNum" id="pb30">[<a href="#pb30">30</a>]</span>Lord of the world divided the Red Sea for them, they all opened their mouths and sang
as one man, the song, as it is written, “Then sang Moses and the children of Israel.”
(Exod. xv. 1.) The <i>third</i> song the children of Israel sang when the well of water was given to them, as it
is written, “Then sang Israel.” (Numb. xxi. 17.) The <i>fourth</i> song Moses the prophet sang, when his time came to depart from this world, in which
he reproved the people of the house of Israel, as it is written: “Give ear, O heavens,
and I will speak.” (Deut. xxxii. 1.) The <i>fifth</i> song Joshua the son of Nun sang, when he waged war in Gibeon, and the sun and moon
stood still for him thirty-six hours, and when they left off singing their song, he
himself opened his mouth and sang this song, as it is written: “Then sang Joshua before
the Lord.” (Josh. x. 12.) The <i>sixth</i> song Barak and Deborah sang in the day when the Lord delivered Sisera and his army
into the hands of the children of Israel, as it is written: “Then sang Deborah, &amp;c.”
(Judg. v. 11.) The <i>seventh</i> song Hannah sang when a son was given her by the Lord, as it is written: “And Hannah
prayed prophetically, and said.” (1 Sam. ii. 1, and the Targum <i lang="la">in loco</i>.) The <i>eighth</i> song David the King of Israel sang for all the wonders which the Lord did for him.
He opened his mouth and sang a hymn, as it is written: “And David sang in prophecy
before the Lord.” (2 Sam. xxii. 1, and the Targum <i lang="la">in loco</i>.) The <i>ninth</i> song Solomon the King of Israel sang by the Holy Spirit before God, the Lord of the
whole world. And the <i>tenth</i> song the children of the captivity shall sing when they shall be delivered from their
captivity, as it is written and declared by Isaiah the prophet: “This song shall be
unto you for joy, as in the night in which the feast of the passover is celebrated;
and gladness of heart as when the people go to appear before the Lord three times
in the year, with all kinds of music, and with the sound of the timbrel, to go up
to the mountain of the Lord, and to worship before the Lord, the Mighty One of Israel.”
(Is. xxx. 29, and the Targum <i lang="la">in loco</i>.)
</p>
<p><a href="#v1.2">2</a>. <i>Let him kiss me, &amp;c.</i>—Solomon the prophet said, “Blessed be the name of the Lord who has given us the law
through Moses the great scribe, written upon two tables of stone; and the six parts
of the Mishna and the Talmud traditionally, and who spoke with us face to face, as
a man that kissed his friend, because of his great love wherewith he loved us above
the seventy nations.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1446src" href="#xd31e1446">35</a>
</p>
<p><a href="#v1.3">3</a>. <i>Thy perfumes, &amp;c.</i>—At the report of thy wonders and mighty deeds which thou hast done for thy people
the house of Israel, all the nations trembled who heard of thy famous strength, and
thy great miracles; and in all the earth was heard thy holy name, which is more excellent
than the anointing oil that was poured upon the heads of kings and priests; therefore
the righteous love to walk after thy good way, because they shall inherit both this
world and the world to come.
</p>
<p><a href="#v1.4">4</a>. <i>Draw me, &amp;c.</i>—When the people of the house of Israel went out of Egypt the shechinah of the Lord
of the world went before them in a pillar of cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire
by night, and the righteous of that <span class="pageNum" id="pb31">[<a href="#pb31">31</a>]</span>generation said, Lord of the whole world, draw us after thee, and we will run in thy
good way! Bring us to the foot of Mount Sinai, and give us thy law out of thy treasury
in heaven, and we will rejoice and be glad <i>in the twenty-two letters</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1487src" href="#xd31e1487">36</a> with which it is written, and we will remember them, and love thy divine nature,
and withdraw ourselves from the idols of the nations; and all the righteous, who do
that which is right before thee, shall fear thee and love thy commandments.
</p>
<p><a href="#v1.5">5</a>. <i>I am swarthy, &amp;c.</i>—When the house of Israel made the calf, their faces became black, like the sons of
Cush, who dwelt in the tents of Kedar; but when they returned by repentance, and were
forgiven, the shining splendour of their faces was increased to that of angels, because
they made the curtains for the tabernacle, and the shechinah of the Lord dwelt among
them; and Moses, their teacher, went up to heaven and made peace between them and
their King.
</p>
<p><a href="#v1.6">6</a>. <i>Do not look down upon me, &amp;c.</i>—The congregation of Israel said before all the nations, Do not despise me because
I am blacker than you, for I have done your deeds, and worshipped the sun and moon;
for false prophets have been the cause that the fierce anger of the Lord has come
upon me, and they taught me to worship your idols, and to walk in your laws; but the
Lord of the world, who is my God, I did not serve, and did not walk in his precepts,
and did not keep his commandments and laws.
</p>
<p><a href="#v1.7">7</a>. <i>Tell me, &amp;c.</i>—When the time came for Moses the prophet to depart from this world, he said to the
Lord, It is revealed to me that this people will sin, and be carried into captivity;
show me now how they shall be governed and dwell among the nations, whose decrees
are oppressive as the heat and the scorching sun in the summer solstice, and wherefore
is it that they shall wander among the flocks of the sons of Esau and Ishmael, who
make their idols equal to thee, as though they were thy companions.
</p>
<p><a href="#v1.8">8</a>. <i>If thou knowest not, &amp;c.</i>—The Holy One, blessed be his name, said to Moses, the prophet, “I suffer myself to
be entreated to abolish their captivity; the congregation of Israel, which is like
a fair damsel, and which my soul loves, she shall walk in the ways of the righteous,
and shall order her prayers according to the order of her governors and leaders, and
instruct her children, who are like to the kids of the goats, to go to the synagogue
and the schools; and by the merits of this they shall be governed in the captivity,
until the time that I send King Messiah, and he shall lead them quietly to their habitations;
yea, he shall bring them to the house of the sanctuary, which David and Solomon, the
shepherds of Israel, shall build for them.”
</p>
<p><a href="#v1.9">9</a>. <i>I compare thee, &amp;c.</i>—When Israel went out of Egypt, Pharaoh and his hosts pursued after them with chariots
and horsemen, and their way was shut up on the four sides of them; on the right hand
and on the left were wildernesses full of fiery serpents, and behind them was wicked
Pharaoh with his army, and before them was the Red Sea, what did the holy blessed
God do? He was manifested in the power of his might upon the Red Sea, and dried the
sea up, but the mud he did not dry up. The wicked and the mixed multitude, and the
strangers who were among them, <span class="pageNum" id="pb32">[<a href="#pb32">32</a>]</span>said, The waters of the sea he was able to dry up, but the mud he was not able to
dry up. In that very hour the fierce anger of the Lord came upon them, and he sought
to drown them in the waters of the sea, as Pharaoh, and his army, and his chariots,
and his horsemen, and his horses were drowned, had it not been for Moses the Prophet,
who spread his hands in prayer before the Lord, and turned away the anger of the Lord
from them. Then he and the righteous of that generation opened their mouths, and sang
a song, and passed through the Red Sea on dry land, through the merits of Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob, the beloved of the Lord.
</p>
<p><a href="#v1.10">10</a>. <i>Beautiful are thy cheeks, &amp;c.</i>—When they went out into the wilderness the Lord said to Moses, “How comely is this
people, that the words of the law should be given unto them, and they shall be as
a bridle in their jaws, that they may not depart out of the good way, as a horse turneth
not aside that has a bridle in his jaws; and how fair is their neck to bear the yoke
of my commandments; and it shall be upon them as a yoke upon the neck of a bullock
which plougheth in the field, and feeds both itself and its owner.”
</p>
<p><a href="#v1.11">11</a>. <i>Circlets of gold, &amp;c.</i>—Then was it said to Moses, “Go up into heaven, and I will give thee the two tables
of stone, hewn out of the sapphire of the throne of my glory, shining as the best
gold, disposed in rows, written with my finger, on which are engraven the ten commandments,
purer than silver that is purified seven times seven, which is the number of the things
explained in them in forty-nine various ways, and I shall give them by thy hands to
the people of the house of Israel.”
</p>
<p><a href="#v1.12">12</a>. <i>While the King, &amp;c.</i>—Whilst Moses, their teacher, was in heaven to receive the two tables of stone, and
the law and the commandments, the wicked of that generation and the mixed multitude
that was among them rose up and made a golden calf, and caused their works to stink,
and an evil report of them went out in the world; for before this time a fragrant
odour of them was diffused in the world, but afterwards they stank like nard, the
smell of which is very bad, and the plague of leprosy came down upon their flesh.
</p>
<p><a href="#v1.13">13</a>. <i>A bag of myrrh, &amp;c.</i>—At that time the Lord said to Moses, “Go down, for the people have corrupted themselves,
desist from speaking to me, and I will destroy them.” Then Moses returned and asked
mercy of the Lord, and the Lord remembered for them the binding of Isaac, whom his
father bound, on Mount Moriah, upon the altar; and the Lord turned from his fierce
anger, and caused his shechinah to dwell among them as before.
</p>
<p><a href="#v1.14">14</a>. <i>A bunch of cypress flowers, &amp;c.</i>—So then went Moses down with the two tables of stone in his hands; and, because of
the sins of Israel, his hands grew heavy, and the tables fell and were broken. Then
went Moses and ground the calf to powder, and scattered the dust of it upon the brook,
and made the children of Israel to drink it, and slew all that deserved to die, and
went up a second time into heaven, and prayed before the Lord, and made atonement
for the children of Israel; then was the commandment to make a tabernacle and an ark.
Immediately Moses hastened and made the tabernacle, and all its furniture, and the
ark; and he put in the ark the two other tables, and appointed the sons of Aaron,
the priests, to offer the offerings upon the altar, and to pour the wine upon the
offerings; <span class="pageNum" id="pb33">[<a href="#pb33">33</a>]</span>but from whence had they wine to pour? For in the wilderness they had no proper place
for sowing; neither had they fig-trees, nor vines, nor pomegranates; but they went
to the vineyards of En-gedi, and took clusters of grapes from thence, and pressed
wine out of them, and poured it upon the altar, the fourth part of a hin to one lamb.
</p>
<p><a href="#v1.15">15</a>. <i>Behold thou art beautiful, &amp;c.</i>—When the children of Israel performed the will of their King, he himself praised
them in the family of the holy angels, and said, “How fair are thy works, my daughter,
my beloved, O congregation of Israel, in the time that thou doest my will, and studiest
in the words of my law; and how well ordered are thy works and thy affairs, as young
doves that are fit to be offered upon the altar!”
</p>
<p><a href="#v1.16">16</a>. <i>Behold thou art comely, &amp;c.</i>—The congregation of Israel answered before the Lord of the world, and thus said,
“How fair is the shechinah of thy holiness, when thou dwellest among us, and receivest
prayers with acceptance; and when thou dwellest in our beloved bed, and our children
are multiplied in the world, and we increase and multiply like a tree that is planted
by a stream of water, whose leaf is fair, and whose fruit is plenteous!”
</p>
<p><a href="#v1.17">17</a>. <i>The beams of, &amp;c.</i>—Solomon, the prophet, said, “How beautiful is the house of the sanctuary of the Lord,
which is built by my hands, of wood of Gulmish; but far more beautiful will be the
house of the sanctuary which shall be built in the days of the King Messiah, the beams
of which will be of the cedars of the garden of Eden, and whose rafters will be of
cypress, pine, and box.”</p>

</p>
<p>The precedent of the Talmud in taking the beloved as <i>the Lord</i>, and the loved one as <i>the Congregation of Israel</i>, and in explaining the text in such a manner as to make it square with her doings,
has quite prepared us for the Chaldee exposition, the author of which most probably
was himself one of the later Talmudists. How could the paraphrast do otherwise? “Are
not the words of <i>the sages</i> more excellent than even the wine of the Law?”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1585src" href="#xd31e1585">37</a> “Is not he who transgresses the words of the scribes more guilty than he who transgresses
the words of the Law?”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1590src" href="#xd31e1590">38</a> Having, therefore, been once settled by the sages that this Song describes the doings
and sufferings of Israel, it only remained for the expositors to apply their exegetical
canons, viz.: of transposing, changing, or omitting letters; explaining words by others
of a similar sound; making each letter of a word begin another word; reducing an expression
to its numerical value, and explaining the text accordingly, &amp;c. &amp;c., in order to
palm upon this book, in a consecutive <span class="pageNum" id="pb34">[<a href="#pb34">34</a>]</span>order, the remarkable events in connection with the history of the Jews.
</p>
<p>Thus, the love of God to Israel, which was greater than to all <i>the seventy other nations</i> mentioned in Ch. i. 2, was obtained by reducing the word <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יין‎</span> to its numerical value, <i>seventy</i>; <i>the two worlds</i>, in verse 3, which the pious are to inherit, were obtained by changing <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עלמות‎</span> <i>maidens</i>, into <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עולמות‎</span> <i>worlds</i>, according to the example of the Talmud;<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1618src" href="#xd31e1618">39</a> <i>the twenty-two letters</i> with which the Law is written, in verse 4, were obtained by reducing the word <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בך‎</span> to its numerical value; <i>the Tabernacle</i>, in verse 5, was obtained from the word <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ירעות‎</span>, and <i>the effected peace</i> by changing the proper name <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שלמה‎</span> into <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שלום‎</span> <i>peace</i>; the worship of <i>the sun and moon</i>, in verse 6, was obtained from the word <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שמש‎</span> <i>sun</i>; <i>the ploughing bullock</i>, in verse 10, was obtained by changing <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תורים‎</span> <i>ringlet</i>, and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חרוזים‎</span> <i>necklace</i>, into <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תור חרז‎</span>; <i>the two tables shining as the best gold</i>, verse 11, were obtained by rendering <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תורי זהב‎</span> <i>golden Laws</i>, and <i>the seven times seven</i>, or <i>the forty different interpretations of the Law</i>, by reducing the word <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏זהב‎</span> to its numerical value, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ז‎</span> being <i>seven</i>, and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ה‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ב‎</span> <i>seven</i>, and then multiplying seven by seven; <i>the binding of Isaac</i>, in verse 13, was obtained by rendering <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צרור המור‎</span> by <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ערור המוריה‎</span> <i>the binding of Moriah</i>; <i>the sin of the calf</i>, and <i>the atonement of that</i>, in verse 14, were obtained by changing <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עין גדי‎</span> <i>En-gedi</i>, into <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עון עגל‎</span> <i>the sin of the calf</i>, and by substituting <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כפר‎</span> <i>pardon</i>, for <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כופר‎</span> <i>cypress-flower</i>, according to the example of the Talmud.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1733src" href="#xd31e1733">40</a> This is the development of Hagadic exegesis, and this the paraphrase appealed to
in support of the allegorical interpretation, and in the track of which future allegorists
more or less follow.
</p>
<p>892–942. From the Chaldee paraphrase to R. Saadias Gaon, a period of about 350 years,
thick darkness covers the annals of Jewish literature. With him, however, a new epoch
begins to dawn. Saadias was born at Pithom, in Egypt, about the year 892, and died
in the year 942. He was “Gaon,” or spiritual head of <span class="pageNum" id="pb35">[<a href="#pb35">35</a>]</span>the Jews in Babylon, and is well known by his translation of the Bible into Arabic,
the Pentateuch of which is inserted in Walton’s Polyglott.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1741src" href="#xd31e1741">41</a> Among the many philosophical and exegetical works this eminent man bequeathed to
posterity, is a commentary on the Song of Songs, which was originally written in Arabic,
and was translated into Hebrew by some unknown individual. This work is exceedingly
rare, and I have happily found a copy of the original Constantinople edition in the
British Museum, of which Dukes was not aware when he wrote his “<i lang="de">Literarische Mittheilungen</i>.” The view that Saadias takes is that “<i>Solomon relates in it the history of the Jews, beginning with their Exodus from Egypt,
and extending it beyond the coming of the Messiah</i>.” Thus far he agrees with the Targum, but his commentary on the text is entirely
at variance with that paraphrase.
</p>
<p>According to Saadias, Ch. i. 2–iii. 5, describes the bondage of Israel in Egypt, their
liberation, the giving of the Law, the battles with Sihon, Og, and the King of Aroar,
the wrath of God at the time of the spies, &amp;c. Ch. iii. 6–iv. 7, describes the erection
of the Tabernacle, the various journeys in the wilderness, the high position of Moses
and Aaron, &amp;c. Hitherto Israel has been called by the appellation <i>my loved one</i>, for they had not as yet entered Canaan; henceforth they are called <i>bride</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כלה‎</span>), because God takes them into the promised land; just as a bridegroom calls his loved
one <i>bride</i>, when he takes her home. Ch. iv. 8–v. 1, describes Israel’s entrance into Canaan,
the building of the first Temple, the separation of <span class="pageNum" id="pb36">[<a href="#pb36">36</a>]</span>Judah and Israel, the Shechinah departing from Israel and abiding with Judah, and
the people coming up to Jerusalem to the three great festivals. Ch. v. 2–vi. 3, describes
the rebellion of Israel and Ahaz, God sending prophets to warn them to repent, the
destruction of the Temple, the Babylonian captivity, Israel’s liberation, the building
of the second Temple, and the covenant of God with his repenting people. Ch. vi. 4–ix.
describes the twofold condition of the people that returned from Babylon, some of
whom were godly, while others took strange women, forgot the holy language, and were
therefore called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שחר‎</span> <i>dawn</i>, being neither real light nor real darkness, neither pious nor wicked. Ch. vi. 10–vii.
9, refers to the present dispersion, in which the Jews, though being many days without
a king, without a priest, &amp;c., say we still live in the fear of God, and are His.
Ch. vii. 12–viii. 4, refers to the sufferings of the Messiah ben Joseph, the manifestation
of the Messiah ben David, the obedience of Israel to God in those days, and to the
Lord’s rejoicing over them as a bridegroom over his bride. Ch. viii. 5, to the end,
describes Israel restored, the third Temple built, and all the people walking according
to the will of the Lord.
</p>
<p>The principal persons in this Song are understood in the following manner: “the beloved”
is <i>the Lord</i>; “the loved one,” <i>the Congregation of Israel</i>; “the companions of the beloved,” (Ch. i. 7,) are <i>Moses</i>, <i>Aaron</i>, and <i>Miriam</i>; “the daughters of Jerusalem,” <i>the Congregation of Israel</i>; “the little sister,” <i>the two tribes and a half</i>; “the speaker,” <i>the Lord</i>; “the inhabitant of the gardens,” is <i>the sages</i>; “the companions,” in the same verse, are <i>the Israelites</i> wishing to listen to the teaching of their sages.
</p>
<p>The following is a specimen of R. Saadias’s commentary, the Hebrew of which is given
in the note.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1801src" href="#xd31e1801">42</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first"><a href="#v1.1">1</a>–3. <i>The Song of Songs</i>, &amp;c.—Know, my brother, that you will find a great diversity of opinions as regards
the interpretation of this Song of <span class="pageNum" id="pb37">[<a href="#pb37">37</a>]</span>Songs; and it must be confessed that there is reason for it, since the Song of Songs
is like a lock, the key of which hath been lost. Some maintain that it refers to the
kingdom of Israel; others say that it refers to the days of the Messiah; and others
again affirm that it refers to the time of the dispersion and the Messiah, and assert
that by <i>beloved</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דוד‎</span>) the Messiah is meant, and by <i>bride</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כלה‎</span>) is meant the law (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תורה‎</span>). But this is a sin, an error, and a great heresy. The truth is, that by <i>beloved</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דוד‎</span>) is meant <i>the Lord</i>, for it is written, “I will sing to my beloved a song of love respecting his vineyard”
(Isa. v. 1), which the prophet Isaiah explains (verse 7), “The vineyard of the Lord
of Hosts is the house of Israel.” Solomon relates in this book the history of the
Jews commencing with their Exodus from Egypt until after the coming of the Messiah,
and compares the position of Israel to God to that of a bride to a bridegroom, because
she (Israel) is dear to him, and he to her. When he first takes her from her father’s
house he calls her <i>my friend</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רעיתי‎</span>), when he brings her to his house he calls her <i>my bride</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כלה‎</span>), when she finds favour in his eyes he calls her <i>my sister</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אחותי‎</span>), and praises her from head to foot; then he is angry with her, and she returns and
praises him from head to foot; then he praises her a second time. And, because it
is unlawful for a bridegroom and bride to come together without a marriage-contract
and witnesses, therefore Solomon begins with the words, “Let him give me kisses of
his mouth;” that is, the commandments and the statutes, comprising both the written
and the oral law which the Lord gave to Israel through the pious Moses, Aaron, and
Miriam, so that Israel’s fame went forth into the world in consequence of their wisdom,
as it is written, “And thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty,” &amp;c.
(Ezek. xvi. 14), so much so that many of the nations desired to be gathered under
the wings of the shechinah and become Jews; and these are the mixed multitudes, Jethro
and others, and therefore it is said, “Thy perfumes are good in odour,” that is, the
Lord tried them from the departure out of Egypt till their entrance into Canaan whether
they would walk in his ways, as it is written, “Thou didst follow me in the wilderness,”
&amp;c. Jer. ii. 2.
</p>
<p><a href="#v1.4">4</a>. <i>Draw me</i>, &amp;c.—Having related in this verse how Israel walked in the fear of the Lord, and
received the ten commandments in the 6th of <span class="pageNum" id="pb38">[<a href="#pb38">38</a>]</span>Sivan, and then made the calf on the 17th of Tamuz, Solomon in astonishment says in
their name,
</p>
<p><a href="#v1.5">5</a>. <i>I am swarthy, &amp;c.</i>—That is, I am swarthy, but comely; I am swarthy because of making the calf, but comely
because of receiving the ten commandments; and Israel says that his sin has been forgiven
through the three thousand men, the wicked among Israel, who served idols, who were
killed before the sun to atone for the great sin, as it is written, “For thou hadst
done it in secret, but I will do it before all Israel, and before the sun<span class="corr" id="xd31e1876" title="Not in source">”</span> (2 Sam. xii. 11, 12); and the nations made me <i>keeper</i> of the service of other gods, for I served strange gods, as it is written, “And they
changed their glory into the likeness of a calf that eateth grass” (Psal. cv. 25.)</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>The reader will have observed that this early commentator does already compare the
Song of Songs <i>to a lock, the key of which has been lost</i>, and refers to several modes in which it has been interpreted.
</p>
<p>1000–1040. The allegorical interpretation was nevertheless introduced into the Jewish
liturgical services in the middle ages, when they were seeking, from traditions, dogmas,
biblical events, &amp;c., to construct sacred hymns and poems to be said or sung at their
feasts and fasts.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1887src" href="#xd31e1887">43</a> Being regarded as representing the departure of Israel from Egypt (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יציאת מצרים‎</span>), and their subsequent history in confirmation of Jehovah’s covenant with them, the
Song of Songs is used in a poetical paraphrase on the first and second morning services
of the Passover feast, which was designed to celebrate the Exodus from Egypt as the
commencement of the conjugal relation between God and his people. For the same reason,
the book itself is read in the synagogue on the Sabbath of the middle days of the
Passover (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חול המועד של פסח‎</span>). The poetical paraphrase above alluded to is in an alphabetical form, has the author’s
name in it, and each stanza closes with a quotation from the book in regular order,
which renders the paraphrastic meaning artificial and obscure. Some idea of it may
be gathered from the following version which we have made of R. Solomon <span class="pageNum" id="pb39">[<a href="#pb39">39</a>]</span>ben Judah Hababli’s paraphrase, comprising the first five verses of the Song of Songs.

<p class="first">It must, however, be borne in mind that the synagogal poetry was not authorized to
express the creed of the whole nation; which is evident from the fact that many learned
and pious Jews unscrupulously, and without censure, rejected some of its opinions.
Some of these poems were composed by prelectors of separate congregations, and for
the use of the particular synagogues in which they officiated. The adoption or rejection
of any such poem entirely depended upon the influence of the prelector on his congregation,
and upon the theme and merit of the composition. The poetical paraphrase of the allegorical
interpretation of the Song of Songs was sure to be adopted because of the consolation
which it imparts to the <span class="pageNum" id="pb40">[<a href="#pb40">40</a>]</span>dispersed and suffering Israelites, inasmuch as it assures them that God has not cast
them off, that He is still their beloved, and they are still his loved ones, and that
he will speedily be reunited to them.
</p>
<p>1040–1105. Through R. Solomon ben Isaac, the founder of the Germano-French Rabbinical
literature, this encouraging allegorical interpretation was introduced into Germany
and France, where the suffering Jews obtained consolation. This distinguished commentator,
commonly called <i>Rashi</i>, and, through the misleading of Buxtorf, erroneously named <i>Jarchi</i>, was born at Troyes, in Champagne, in 1040, where he also died, about 1105.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1980src" href="#xd31e1980">48</a>
</p>
<p>“<i>My opinion is</i>,” says Rashi, “<i>that Solomon foresaw, by the aid of the Holy Spirit, that Israel would be carried
into sundry captivities, and undergo sundry dissolutions; that they would lament in
their captivity over their former glory, and recall the former love, which God manifested
for them above all other nations; that they would say, ‘I will go and return to my
first husband, for then was it better with me than now’</i> (Hos. ii. 9); <i>that they would acknowledge His kindness and their own rebellion</i>, and the good things which He promised <i>to give them in the latter days</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, at the coming of Messiah.)
</p>
<p>“<i>This book is written by inspiration, and represents a wife forsaken by her husband,
and shut up, longing after him, recalling to her mind her love in youth to her beloved,
and confessing her guilt; her beloved sympathising with her affection, and remembering
the kindness of her youth, the charms of her beauty, and her good works, which had
tied him to her with an everlasting love.</i>
</p>
<p>“<i>The design of this book is to show to Israel that God has not afflicted her</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, <i>Israel</i>) <i>willingly; that though He did send her away, He has not cast her off; that she is
still His wife, and He her husband, and that He will again be united to her.</i>”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2015src" href="#xd31e2015">49</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb41">[<a href="#pb41">41</a>]</span></p>
<p>According to Rashi, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דוד‎</span> represents God as <i>a husband</i>, and the “loved one” the congregation of Israel, as <i>a wife</i> forsaken for a time by him; the “companions of the beloved” are <i>the heathen kings and princes</i>, under the figure of <i>wolves</i>; “the daughters of Jerusalem,” are <i>the heathen nations</i>; the “brothers of the loved one,” are <i>the Egyptians</i>; the “little sister” is the <i>forsaken wife</i> of the Song, &amp;c. &amp;c.
</p>
<p>The following is a specimen of Rashi’s commentary:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first"><a href="#v1.1">1</a>. <i>The Song of Songs</i>, &amp;c.—Our Rabbins state, that whenever Solomon is mentioned in this Song, it signifies
the Holy One, the King of Peace. This is confirmed by the fact that the name of Solomon’s
father is not here given, as in Prov. i. 1 and Eccl. i. 1. This most excellent Song
was addressed to God by his people, the congregation of Israel. Rabbi Akiba says,
that the world was not worthy of the day in which the Song of Songs was given to Israel;
for all the Scriptures are holy, but the Song of Songs is most holy. Rabbi Eliezer
ben Azariah says, it is like to a king who took a measure of wheat, and gave it to
the baker, saying, Produce from it so much flour, so much bran, and so much chaff,
and make me a refined and excellent cake of the flour; so all Scriptures are holy,
but this Song is most holy; for the whole of this book teaches the fear of God and
submission to his kingdom.
</p>
<p><a href="#v1.2">2</a>. <i>Let him kiss me</i>, &amp;c.—This Song Israel utters in her captivity and widowhood. Oh that King Solomon
would give me kisses of His mouth, as in the time of yore! Some kiss the hand, and
others the shoulders; but I desire that He should behave to me as in former days,
viz., kiss my mouth as a bridegroom kisses his bride; for Thy caresses are better
than all the banquets of wine, and all joys and pleasures. It is a Hebrew idiom to
call every banquet of pleasure and joy by the name of <i>wine</i> (Comp. Esth. vii. 2; Isaiah xxiv. 9; v. 12). This is the literal sense; but, according
to the allegory, this refers to the giving of the Law, and God’s speaking with Israel
face to face. These favours still continue to be more precious to them than any delights;
and as they are assured by God that He will appear again to reveal the secrets and
mysteries of the Law, Israel prays to Him for the fulfilment of His promises. This
is the meaning of “Let him kiss me!”
</p>
<p><a href="#v1.3">3</a>. <i>Thy perfumes</i>, &amp;c.—A good name is called good oil. The fragrance of Thy name is so excellent that
the ends of the earth have smelt it when they heard of Thy fame and of Thy great wonders
in Egypt. Thy name is called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שמן‎</span>, <i>i.e.</i>, Thou art oil, and art constantly poured forth, so that Thy sweet odour might be
widely diffused. This is the nature of good oil. As long as it is sealed in a bottle,
it does not emit any smell; but when the bottle is opened, and the oil poured into
a vessel, the smell is diffused. <i>The maidens love thee.</i> Jethro, hearing of the wonderful doings of God in Egypt, confessed the God of Israel
(Exodus xviii.); so Rahab, when she heard that the Lord had dried up the waters of
the Red Sea, became a proselyte (Joshua ii. 11). By the <i>maidens</i> are meant the Gentiles; they are so called because God is represented as a youth.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb42">[<a href="#pb42">42</a>]</span></p>
<p><a href="#v1.4">4</a>. <i>Draw me</i>, &amp;c.—I gathered from Thy messengers that Thou didst wish to draw me, and I immediately
replied, We will run after Thee to be Thy wife. <i>He has brought me</i>, &amp;c. And up to the present time I still rejoice, and am glad that I have been united
to Thee. <i>We celebrate</i>, &amp;c. Even now, though a living widow, I celebrate Thy love more than a banquet of
pleasure and mirth. <i>They love thee</i>, &amp;c. I and my forefathers, in their days, have loved Thee with fervent and upright
love, without deception. This is the literal meaning according to the context. But,
according to the allegory, Israel reminds God of the kindness of their youth and the
love of their espousals (Jer. ii. 2), of their following Him in the wilderness, a
land of aridity and the shadow of death, whither they took no provisions, because
they believed in Him and in His messenger, and did not say, How shall we follow Thee
in the wilderness, a place destitute of fertility and food? but went after Him, and
“He brought <i>them into his apartments</i>:” that is, surrounded them with the protecting clouds. And even now, though in distress
and affliction, they rejoice and are glad in Him and delight in the Law; and herein
<i>celebrate His love more than wine</i>, and manifest <i>their sincere attachment to Him</i>.
</p>
<p><a href="#v1.5">5</a>. <i>I am swarthy</i>, &amp;c.—You, my companions, let me not be lightly esteemed in your eyes, although my
Husband forsook me because of my swarthiness; for I am swarthy because of the tanning
sun, yet I am comely because of the symmetry of my beautiful limbs. If I am swarthy,
like the tents of Kedar, which are discoloured by the rain, in consequence of their
being constantly spread out in the wilderness, I shall easily be washed, and be as
beautiful as the curtains of Solomon. The allegorical meaning is, the congregation
of Israel speaks this to the Gentiles,—I am swarthy in my own works, but I am comely
in the works of my fathers; and some of my own works even are good. And though I am
tainted with the sin of the calf, I have, to counterbalance this, the merit of accepting
the Law. Israel calls the Gentiles “daughters of Jerusalem,” because Jerusalem is
to be the metropolis of all nations, as it is predicted, “And I will give them to
thee for <i>daughters</i>” (Ezek. xvi. 61); and, again, “Ekron and her <i>daughters</i>” (Josh. xv. 44).</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>Rashi also says, that he had seen “<i>a number of other commentaries on this Song; some containing an exposition of the
whole Book, and others of separate passages, but they are compatible neither with
the language of Scripture, nor with the connexion of the verses</i>.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2108src" href="#xd31e2108">50</a>
</p>
<p>1085–1155. The spread of this consoling allegorical interpretation in France and Germany
was promoted by the commentary<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2113src" href="#xd31e2113">51</a> of the distinguished R. Samuel ben Meier, <span class="pageNum" id="pb43">[<a href="#pb43">43</a>]</span>called <i>Rashbam</i>, the grandson of <i>Rashi</i>, who was born about 1085, and died about 1155.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2126src" href="#xd31e2126">52</a>
</p>
<p>Rashbam too affirms that this book “<i>represents captive Israel as a virgin sighing and mourning for her beloved, who left
her and went afar off, as describing his everlasting love to her, declaring in a Song,
‘Such an ardent love did my beloved manifest when with me,’ and telling her friends
and companions in a colloquial manner, ‘So did my beloved speak to me, and so did
I answer him.’</i>”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2136src" href="#xd31e2136">53</a> In the explanations of the principal persons Rashbam generally agrees with Rashi.
</p>
<p>The following is a specimen of his commentary:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first"><a href="#v1.1">1</a>. <i>The Song of Songs</i>—That is, a song celebrated above all songs, like <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אלהי אלהיﬦ‎</span> the great and awful God, above all gods, and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ﬡדוני אדניﬦ‎</span> the great Lord above all lords. <i>Which is Solomon’s.</i> That is, King Solomon composed it by inspiration. Foreseeing the Israelites in their
captivity sighing after the Holy One who went away from them, as a bridegroom separates
himself from his beloved, Solomon sings this song in the name of the congregation
of Israel, who is like a bride to Him (God). <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אשר לשלמה‎</span> describes Solomon as the author, compare <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תפלה למשה‎</span>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תהלה לדוד‎</span>.
</p>
<p><a href="#v1.2">2</a>. <i>Would that</i>, &amp;c.—Would that my Beloved came, and kissed me kisses of <i>His</i> mouth on <i>my</i> mouth in his great love as in the days of old; for the expressions of His love are
better, pleasanter, and sweeter than any delicious banquet. <i>Thy caresses.</i> The loved one sometimes addresses herself to her beloved as if he were <i>present</i>, and at other times she speaks of him to her companions, as if he were <i>absent</i>. <i>More than wine</i>, <i>i.e.</i> more than sweet beverages called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יַיִן‎</span>. According to the allegorical meaning, this refers to the law delivered to Israel
mouth to mouth.
</p>
<p><a href="#v1.3">3</a>. <i>Thy perfumes</i>, &amp;c.—Because of Thy good ointment of balsam, the odour of which extended to the end
of the earth, and was poured out from vessel to vessel, therefore is Thy name called
ointment. Comp. Eccl. vii. 1. “A good name is better than precious ointment.” By the
extension of youthful love is meant the wonders which the Holy One performed for the
congregation of Israel in Egypt, on account of which His name and power became known
among the nations, as it is written, “The priest of Midian heard, &amp;c.” Exod. xviii.
1: and again, what is said by Rahab the harlot, “For we have heard how the Lord dried
up the water, &amp;c.” Josh. ii. 10. And again, “The people shall hear and be afraid,”
Exod. xv. 14.
</p>
<p><a href="#v1.4">4</a>. <i>Draw me</i>, &amp;c.—Draw me to Thee, and I and my congregation will run after Thee, as in the days
of old, when the King, my beloved, brought me into His chambers; and, while running
after Thee, we will rejoice and <span class="pageNum" id="pb44">[<a href="#pb44">44</a>]</span>be glad in Thee, and celebrate Thy love and the expressions of Thy affection above
any banquet of wine and beverages; for all the world loves Thee with upright love.
This refers to the congregation of Israel, who sighs and makes supplication before
the Holy One, to bring her out from her captivity, as He had formerly brought her
out of Egypt, and led her into His chambers, <i>i.e.</i>, the tabernacle, where they served Him continually.
</p>
<p><a href="#v1.5">5</a>. <i>I am swarthy</i>, &amp;c.—Oh, my companions, virgin daughters of Ishmael, do not disdain and deride me
on account of my blackness, saying, Because I am black, therefore my Beloved left
me; for, although I am black as regards the appearance of my face, like the tents
of Kedar, yet I am comely and graceful in body and stature, like the curtains of King
Solomon, which are becoming and suitable to royalty. Thus the congregation of Israel,
whom the nations reproach on account of her sins and transgressions which she committed,
answers: True, I have sinned; and woe to me, for I am wandering in captivity for it;
yet I am comely, I am of royal blood, and have the merits of my fathers; and the Holy
One, in the latter days, will restore me to my former state, and liberate me from
the iron furnace of captivity. The <i>daughters of Jerusalem</i> are the heathen. Compare “I will give them to thee to be thy <i>daughters</i>.” Ezek. xvi. 61. <i>The tents of Kedar</i> are black, because the sons of Kedar sojourn in deserts and dwell in tents, and not
in houses.</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>1093–1168. While Rashi and Rashbam, by means of this allegorical interpretation, assuaged
the sufferings of their brethren in France and Germany, the celebrated Abraham Ibn-Ezra
ben Meier, also called <i>Ibn-Ezra</i> and <i>Raba</i>, who was born in Toledo in 1093, and died in 1168,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2225src" href="#xd31e2225">54</a> administered consolation through the same medium to his suffering brethren in Spain,
shewing them that this Song recounts the past wonderful dealings of God with his beloved
people from the very call of Abraham, and the blessings reserved for them at the coming
of the Messiah, who shall gather them from among all nations, and bring them back
to the land flowing with milk and honey.
</p>
<p>Thus Ibn Ezra maintains that “<i>This book is allegorical, and describes the history of Israel; commencing with the
days of our Father, Abraham, and coming down to the days of the Messiah; just as the
Song of Moses</i> (Deut. xxxii.) <i>begins with the dispersion of the human family, and finishes with the final ingathering
of Israel, after the battle of Gog and Magog. Do not wonder that <span class="pageNum" id="pb45">[<a href="#pb45">45</a>]</span>the Congregation of Israel is here compared to a bride, and the Lord to a bridegroom;
for this is the manner of the prophets</i>.<span class="corr" id="xd31e2248" title="Not in source">”</span> (Comp. Isa. v. 1, lxii. 5, Ezek. xvi. 7, Hos. iii. 1, Psa. xlv. 10.)
</p>
<p>The allegory, according to this distinguished Rabbi, is developed in the suppositious
attachment contracted between a damsel who kept a vineyard, and a shepherd. The representation
of the love of these parties “<i>is suppositious, because such an actual manifestation, in so public a manner as here
recorded, would be regarded as highly improper</i>.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2254src" href="#xd31e2254">55</a>
</p>
<p>“The beloved” represents God; with the exception of viii. 12, where <i>the Messiah</i> is meant; “the loved one” is <i>the Congregation of Israel</i>; “the companions of the beloved” are <i>the pious ancestors</i>; “the daughters of Jerusalem” are <i>the thoughts of the loved one</i>; “the little sister,” in viii. 8, is <i>the two tribes and a half</i>; “the speaker,” in viii. 13, <i>the shechinah</i>; “the companions,” in the same verse, are <i>the angels</i>.
</p>
<p>The commentary consists of three different glosses: in the first, the words are explained;
in the second, the suppositious history of the attachment of the shepherd and shepherdess
is developed; and in the third gloss, the allegory is evolved from that history. The
following is a specimen of the gloss where the allegory is propounded.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first"><a href="#v1.2">2</a>. <i>Let him kiss me.</i>—He (<i>i.e.</i> Solomon) begins with Abraham, for he is the root of the Jewish nation. By “the kisses
of his mouth” are meant the law and the commandments, as it is written, “Abraham obeyed
my voice and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.” (Gen. xxvi.
5.) Do not wonder that the future (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ישקני‎</span>) is used instead of the past; this is the idiom of the sacred Scriptures, compare
<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ﬡז ישּיר‎</span>, <i>then he sang</i> (Exod. xv. 1, and Psa. cvi. 19); just as we find the contrary, the past used for
the future (Psa. lxxix. 1).—<i>For thy love</i>, &amp;c. <i>i.e.</i><span class="corr" id="xd31e2297" title="Not in source">,</span> to be loved by thee; as the Scriptures testify of God’s love to his people. Compare
“the seed of Abraham whom I love” (Isa. xli. 8); for there is a difference between
<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אוהב‎</span>, <i>loving</i>, and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אהוב‎</span>, <i>loved</i>.
</p>
<p><a href="#v1.3">3</a>. <i>Thy perfumes</i>, &amp;c.—Abraham proclaimed the works of God, and instructed his generation; and wherever
he went he called on the name of the Lord; this is the meaning of “thy name is poured
forth like oil.” <i>Therefore do the damsels love thee.</i>—<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עלמות‎</span> are such as have no husbands, and denote the heathen who had no God, and were brought
by <span class="pageNum" id="pb46">[<a href="#pb46">46</a>]</span>Abraham into union with God; as it is written, “The souls which they had begotten
in Haran” (Gen. xii. 5).
</p>
<p><a href="#v1.4">4</a>. <i>Draw me.</i>—Abraham was drawn after God, and therefore left his native place (Gen. xii. 1). <i>The king has brought me</i>, &amp;c.—God has brought Abraham into the land of Canaan; or it may mean, God has made
him wise in his secrets, and the words, <i>we will praise thy love</i>, denote the altars and groves which Abraham erected and planted wherever he came.
</p>
<p><a href="#v1.5">5</a>. <i>I am swarthy.</i>—This refers to the Egyptian bondage. Although I (<i>i.e.</i> Israel) am swarthy because of some evil deeds committed there; yet I am comely because
of my adhesion to the covenant and to the belief in the unity of God.</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>It has generally been overlooked that Ibn Ezra distinctly states in the second gloss,
in which he professes to give the literal meaning of the narrative, that the lovers
are a <i>shepherd</i> and a <i>shepherdess</i>, and that <i>the king</i> is a <i>separate</i> and <i>distinct</i> person from the beloved shepherd.
</p>
<p>Thus he explains Ch. i. 4, “I <i>rejoice in</i> <span class="asc">THEE</span> (the shepherd) <i>more than if</i> <span class="asc">THE KING</span> <i>had brought me into his apartments</i>.” Again, verse 12, the shepherdess says to the shepherd, “<i>Though my fragrance is so sweet that</i> <span class="asc">THE KING</span>, <i>whilst reclining, desires to smell my nard, yet</i> <span class="asc">MY BELOVED</span> (the shepherd), <i>who is a bundle of myrrh, diffuses a still sweeter fragrance</i>.” Compare also Ch. iii. 6–11, Ch. vi. 8, Ch. viii. 11, 12. This is an important step
to the right understanding of the Book.
</p>
<p>Ibn Ezra also mentions that “<i>The philosophers explain this book to refer to the mysterious harmony of the universe,
and to the union of the divine soul with the earthly body; and that others, again,
explain it literally</i>.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2385src" href="#xd31e2385">56</a> In reference to the last mentioned mode of interpretation, he exclaimed, “<i>Far be it! far be it! to think that the Song of Songs is an amatory composition</i>.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2390src" href="#xd31e2390">57</a>
</p>
<p>1200–1250. The frequent mention made by the preceding commentators of the different
views entertained respecting this Song, will have prepared the reader for the philosophical
interpretation which has been adopted and defended by a large and influential portion
of the Jewish community.
</p>
<p>Joseph Ibn Caspe, a learned author, who lived in the beginning <span class="pageNum" id="pb47">[<a href="#pb47">47</a>]</span>of the thirteenth century, and who wrote expositions on several portions of the Scriptures,
maintains that “<i>this book represents the union between the</i> <span class="asc">ACTIVE INTELLECT</span> (<i>intellectus agens</i>) <i>and the</i> <span class="asc">RECEPTIVE MATERIAL INTELLECT</span> (<i>intellectus materialis</i>),” typified by the beloved and loved one.
</p>
<p>As Caspe’s commentary is short and exceedingly rare, we give a translation of it,
and subjoin the original in the footnote:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">THE COMMENTARY OF IBN CASPE.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2418src" href="#xd31e2418">58</a>
</p>
<p>Joseph Caspe saith: Having commented on Ecclesiastes and Proverbs, which Solomon of
blessed memory has in wisdom composed, it behoves us also to write a few words on
the Song of Songs, which is likewise the composition of Solomon of blessed memory.
I need not, however, explain the words, since they have been explained long before
me. I shall, therefore, confine my remarks to the <i>design</i> of the book in general, and now and then make some observations in particular. The
general design of this book, however, is not my discovery; the luminary (Maimonides)
that shone upon the earth has enlightened our eyes also upon this subject when treating
upon it, especially in part iii. c. 51 (of the More Nebochim); and his hint there
is sufficient for us and for such as ourselves.
</p>
<p>I therefore submit that this book undoubtedly belongs to the second kind of parables
which the teacher of blessed memory (Maimonides) mentions in the beginning of his
book, in which all the words used in the comparison must not be applied to the thing
compared, just as in the case there quoted, which treats on the subject of a beloved
and loved one, like the book before us, with the only difference that the instance
there adduced refers to the union of matter and mind, and this book represents the
union between the <i>active intellect</i> and the <i>receptive, material intellect</i>, which latter is divided into four parts, the highest of which is the <i>imparted intellect</i>. With all the particulars of this book, Solomon merely designed to hint at the subject
in general. It is most certain that he calls here <i>the highest order of the human intellect</i> “the fairest of women,” and the <i>active intellect</i> “the graceful lover;” frequently the <i>whole intellectual mind</i> is meant by the latter phrase, for this is the meaning demanded in several places
of this Book.
</p>
<p>It is well known that the active intellect (<i>intellectus agens</i>) stirs up or brings the receptive intellect (<i>intellectus materialis</i>) from a possibility into activity, as it is known to the philosophers; and that the
receptive intellect <span class="pageNum" id="pb48">[<a href="#pb48">48</a>]</span>requires to seek after this; as it is written, “If thou wilt seek it, it shall be
found of thee.”
</p>
<p>Having explained the general design, we need not dwell upon the particulars; the design
is indicated in a few passages only, whilst the whole is treated in accordance with
the train of a poetical composition and logical science; and this Solomon declares
in the beginning of the book by saying “The Song of Songs.”
</p>
<p>It is, moreover, known that Solomon composed three books which we possess; and as
the prophets of blessed memory spoke in three different kinds of ways; <i>the one</i>, in a plain manner, containing nothing beyond the obvious and literal sense, which
is called <i>all silver</i>; <i>the second</i> entirely symbolical, having no literal meaning whatever, but consisting of mere allegories
or parables, which is called <i>all gold</i>; and <i>the third</i> comprising both the figurative and the literal, which is called <i>apples of gold</i> (under plates of silver); so Solomon wrote the three books—Ecclesiastes, which belongs
to the first kind; the Song of Songs to the second; and Proverbs to the third. Remember
these distinctions, and observe how we are in danger at every step to mistake in the
Law, Hagiography, and Prophets, one for the other, and thus change life into death.
And this leads us to commit one of two errors; we either put into the words a thing
which is false, or, to say the least, make the author say what he did not intend;
in such a case, our words can no more be called a commentary, but form a separate
composition or a book for themselves. I only call that a commentary which thoroughly
comes up to the design of the author of the book. The appearance, however, of each
book of the Bible will indicate to a judicious, clear-headed, and intellectual man,
whether it belongs to the one or the other of the above-mentioned classes. We cannot
here give rules whereby to test this; it is sufficient to say that truth is her own
witness.
</p>
<p>There is another important remark to be made, viz., that allusions are made in this
book to the writings of Moses, as, indeed, Solomon has made in his other books. This
all the prophets have done, in order to explain expressions and synonyms which occur
in the Law of Moses, especially when referring to that part of the Law which treats
on the Creation and the Chariot, the chief objects of the Law. We must study deeply
to understand the wonderful works of the prophets, and after them, the rabbins of
blessed <span class="pageNum" id="pb49">[<a href="#pb49">49</a>]</span>memory, in their respective books; for when they intended to be profound, they did
not mention the same terms employed in the Law, but changed them for other expressions
which are somewhat synonymous with those in the former, <i>e.g.</i>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יין חמר, פרדם‎</span>, wine, vine, vineyard, &amp;c. From this arose the great hyperbole in the writings of
the Rabbins of blessed memory, for wisdom was not hid from them. But this is not necessary
here. The above remarks will suffice for this book according to our design. Praise
be to God, and blessed be his name! Amen.</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>Moses Ibn Tibbon, a celebrated writer of the same age, wrote an elaborate commentary
in which he maintains the same view that “<i>the Song of Songs represents the union of the</i> <span class="asc">RECEPTIVE</span> <i>or</i> <span class="asc">MATERIAL INTELLECT</span> <i>with the</i> <span class="asc">ACTIVE INTELLECT</span>.”
</p>
<p>This commentary has not been printed. A defective MS. containing the Preface, which
is very copious, is to be found in the British Museum, Harleian Collection, No. 5797;
and a complete MS. is in the possession of the Bodleian Library at Oxford.
</p>
<p>1272–1350. The most powerful and ingenious defender of this view is Immanuel ben Solomon.
This most charming Hebrew writer, who is poetically called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אַלוּף הַדַּעַת בְּמַגְדִיאֵל‎</span>, <i>the Prince of Science in Rome</i>, was born in Rome, in 1272, where he was the spiritual head of the Jewish community,
and where he died, in the first half of the fourteenth century. As Immanuel gives
an analysis of this mode of interpretation in his exposition on the first verse, and
as this commentary has not been published, we give a translation of this verse, which
will enable the reader to see how this mode of interpretation is applied to the whole
book. The MS. used for this purpose is in the possession of the British Museum, Harl.

<blockquote>
<p class="first"><i>The Song of Songs.</i>—Immanuel ben R. Solomon of blessed memory, saith, Acknowledging the goodness of the
Lord, I agree with the opinion of our Rabbins, that this book is the most sublime
of all the Books given by inspiration. Expositors, however, differ in its interpretation,
and their opinions are divided, according to the diversity of their knowledge. There
are some—but these are such as go no further than the material world, and that which
their eye sees, looking forward to the good of this world <span class="pageNum" id="pb50">[<a href="#pb50">50</a>]</span>and its glory, to the great reward of their labours and a recompense from God, desiring
to be restored to their greatness, and to the land flowing with milk and honey, and
to have their stomachs filled with the flesh of the Leviathan, and the best of wines
preserved in its grapes—such men interpret this sublime song as having reference to
the history of the Patriarchs, their going down to Egypt, their Exodus from thence
with a mighty hand and outstretched arm, the giving of the Law, the entry into the
land of Canaan, the settlement of Israel in it, their captivity, restoration, the
building of the second Temple, the present dispersion, and their final ingathering
which is to take place. Such interpreters regard this book, which is holy of holies,
as some common book, or historical record of any of the kings, which is of very little
use, and the reading of which is only a loss of time. But there are other sages and
divines, who have attained to know the value of true wisdom; they are separated from
the material world, despise the mere temporal things, heartily desire to know the
courts of the Lord, and have a footing in the Jerusalem which is above, and with heart
and flesh sing to the living God; these have put off the garments of folly, and clothed
themselves in the robes of wisdom, and while searching after the mysteries of this
precious book through the openings of the figures of silver, glanced at golden apples
of the allegory concealed in it. They, in the vessel of their understanding, traversed
its sea, and brought to light from the depth, the reality of the book. Thus they have
declared that the book was composed to explain the possibility of a reunion with the
incorporeal mind, which forms <i>the perceptive faculty</i>, and influences it with abundant goodness.
</p>
<p>The shepherds, accordingly, represent the corporeal intellect which longs after the
influence of the active intellect, and desires to be like it, as much as possible,
to cleave to it, and to come up to its standing, which is the ultimate end of its
purpose.
</p>
<p>These learned divines above mentioned have expounded the design of the book in general,
and explained some of its verses indirectly; but they did not explain it in regular
order from beginning to end, till the celebrated <span class="pageNum" id="pb51">[<a href="#pb51">51</a>]</span>sage, R. Moses Ibn Tibbon, came and explained the book according to wisdom, and his
exposition is, indeed, full of wisdom and excellency. As he, however, passed by several
particulars, not noticing their design, our wise contemporaries, reading the writing
of that learned author, and wishing to enter more fully into all its parts, insisted,
with a command of love, that I should write a complete commentary on the book, keeping
the same path the learned author has pointed out, bringing out all its particulars,
and making discoveries not mentioned in the said book, also paying attention to its
literal meaning, as far as God may enable me.
</p>
<p>Seeing their entreaties, and regarding it a duty to yield to their wishes, I gathered
strength, and made the commentary on the book, according to my feeble abilities. I
kept the plan of the said author, mentioned some of his words, and altered others,
sometimes adding to, and at other times diminishing from what he said, as I was led
by the heavenly Father. Thus I begin. It appears necessary first to mention the design
of the book in general, and its division into sections.
</p>
<p>I submit that all truly wise men who commented upon this book philosophically, saw
clearly that it is divisible into three principal sections.
</p>
<p>The first section extends from chap. i. 2, to ii. 17.
</p>
<p>The second section extends from chap. iii. 1, to v. 1.
</p>
<p>And the third from chap. v. 2, to the end of the book.
</p>
<p>These three sections, moreover, refer to three different kinds of men.
</p>
<p><i>The first section</i>—Chap. i. 2,–ii. 17,—represents man, who either ideally or actually, was in the garden
of Eden before he sinned, and brought into activity his choice for good and evil;
as it is written, “And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he
put the man whom he had formed. And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every
tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food; the tree of life also in the
midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil” (Gen. ii. 8, 9).
The Lord permitted, or commanded him to eat of all the fruit of the garden; but He
pointed out to him one tree of which he was not to eat, lest he should die; as it
is said, “But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of
it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die” (Gen. ii. 17).
And if, as man, he <span class="pageNum" id="pb52">[<a href="#pb52">52</a>]</span>had the choice to eat of the tree of life, he might have eaten and lived for ever,
without mortification or trouble; as it is written, “Behold, I have set before thee
life and good, and death and evil: choose, therefore, of the life, that thou mayest
live” (Deut. xxx. 15). This represents one who endeavours to learn wisdom in its order,
but is afraid lest he should be terrified when looking up to God, seeing that his
fruit is not yet ripe. This is the meaning of what is said in the section, “Turn,
my beloved, and be thou like a gazelle or a young hind upon the mountains of separation”
(Song of Songs ii. 17); and again, “Catch us the foxes, the little foxes, that destroy
the vineyards; for our vineyards are in blossom” (ibid. 15). This teaches that the
fruit was not yet ripe. There is no mention in this first section that the shepherdess
did eat of the fruit. Her saying, “I desired to sit down under its shade, and its
fruit is sweet to my taste” (Song of Songs ii. 3), merely declares her desire, which
is evident from the word <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חמדתי‎</span>. The expression <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פריו‎</span> is here used in the sense of <i>words</i>, <i>wisdom</i>, and <i>instruction</i>. The whole, therefore, of the first section refers to the mind of man when still
young, prior to its developing the end for which its existence was designed, and when
the powers of the body have still the dominion over it, for he has not pursued his
studies farther than mathematics and physics. This first section is again subdivided
into two parts. The first part begins chap. i. 2, and ends ii. 7, and represents one
who fears God and shuns evil; but his knowledge of God is derived from tradition,
and has no wisdom of his own. And the second part (chap. ii. 8 to iii. 1) represents
one who has studied mathematics and physics.
</p>
<p><i>The second section</i> (chap<span class="corr" id="xd31e2598" title="Source: ,">.</span> iii. 1, v. 1) represents one who has found the virtuous woman whose desire is to
her husband, and who seeks her beloved while upon her couch, and in whom her husband
may safely trust; that is, a mind which has brought out its possibility into reality,
and has, as it were, stretched out its hand and taken of the tree of life, and eaten,
and lives for ever. This is meant by the declaration in this section, “Scarcely had
I passed them, when I found him whom my soul loveth. I seized him, and would not let
him go, till I brought him into the house of my mother, <span class="pageNum" id="pb53">[<a href="#pb53">53</a>]</span>into the apartment of her that gave me birth” (Song of Songs iii. 4). The nuptials,
too, are mentioned, and the day of the gladness of his heart (iii. 11), which is the
true spiritual nuptial day and union. It is also stated that he had a couch, as it
is said, “Behold the couch of Solomon” (iii. 7), as well as a palanquin, and was fit
for royalty. He is, moreover, called here <i>King</i> Solomon, whereas, in the remainder, he is merely called Solomon, or Shulamite, in
the feminine, to denote the effeminate state. The beloved also declares that he had
found his loved one a closed garden, and that her branches are an orchard of pomegranates
with delicious fruit: (iv. 12, 13), that is, though most of them are generally sour,
here, however, they are sweet, pleasant, and ripe: he affirms that she is altogether
beautiful, and there is no blemish in her (ver. 7), and calls her <i>bride</i> six times, which he has not done before; for she is his true wife, dear to him above
all. She therefore asks her beloved to “come to his garden, and eat of his pleasant
fruit” (iv. 16), which befits him. This is the import of the words, “Thy shoots are
an orchard of pomegranates with most delicious fruit” (iv. 13): whereby, however,
it must not be understood that she will give to her husband, and make him eat of the
fruit, which properly belongs to the woman, who listened to the words of the serpent,
and was beguiled by him.
</p>
<p>The beloved declares that he did come to his garden, and ate and drank, and also caused
his friends to eat and drink, and that they indulged together in a sumptuous feast;
for “when the righteous have the rule, the city rejoiceth” (Prov. xi. 10). This is
the meaning of the words, “I have come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have
gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk
my wine with my milk: eat, O ye friends, drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved!”
(v. 1.) He, as it were, sent forth and took of the tree of life, and did eat and lived
for ever, without any trouble or hinderance; for he passed through all the three (degrees)
in proper order, he went in and out in peace: that is, he passed through all the degrees,
and finished their proper course, without doing any mischief or committing any error;
and his carnal powers, which are the watchmen who walk in the city, and especially
his intellectual powers, which are those that watch the walls, are all profitable,
and point out to the mind the right way, and never mislead, <span class="pageNum" id="pb54">[<a href="#pb54">54</a>]</span>nor hinder, nor delay its course. She then asks of the watchmen, “Have you seen him
whom my soul loveth?” (iii. 3,) for they (<i>i.e.</i>, the watchmen, who represent the bodily and intellectual powers) are upright, and
their knowledge is perfect, and, as it were, they see and guide; yet they did not
answer her, for it is not in their nature to teach. But no sooner had she passed them,
and was at a distance from them, than she found her beloved, and was united to him,
as it is said, “Scarcely had I passed them, when I found him whom my soul loveth.
I seized him, and would not let him go till I brought him into the house of my mother,
and into the apartment of her that gave me birth” (iii. 4); whereupon they made themselves
a couch and a palanquin, rejoicing, and feasting, and banqueting, as we have already
explained.
</p>
<p>This second section is also subdivided into two parts; the first is from iii. 1 to
verse 6, and the second from iii. 6 to v. 2; the second part is epexegetical of the
first.
</p>
<p><i>The third section</i> (v. 2, viii. 14 inclusive) represents a man who has a sinful wife that has been beguiled
by the carnal appetites, and has listened to them, and eaten of the tree of knowledge
of good and evil, and given also to her husband with her and he has eaten. Mark here
the expression <i>with her</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עמח‎</span>), for man cannot eat of it unless <i>with her</i>; for since God has not revealed it to man, and will not; and man, indeed, has no
access to it, except through the woman; for she finds it and takes it up; and she
is the one who pursues after pleasure, and is drawn after sensual lust. But she does
not seek for her husband when retiring to bed, nor does she wait for him; but, undressing
herself, and washing her feet, and perfuming her fingers with myrrh, which is temporal
instead of eternal ointment, falls asleep, and is even too lazy to open when her beloved
knocks at the door, saying, “Open to me, my sister, my spouse, &amp;c.” Her husband, however,
influences her, and she repents, as she was not in a deep sleep, her heart being awake,
and she opens for her husband in spite of her great laziness; but her beloved withdrew,
and went away. She then sought him, and found him not; she called him, but he answered
her not. The guards of the wall and the patrol of the city found her, and smote her,
and <span class="pageNum" id="pb55">[<a href="#pb55">55</a>]</span>wounded her, and stripped her of her cloak; that is, they misdirected her, had hindered
her from getting to her beloved; for sin once tasted is hard to forsake. As it is
not mentioned in the case of Adam, after being driven from the garden of Eden, that
he ever touched with his hand, and took of the tree of life, and was cured, though
it was open for him to do so; for it is written, “And now, lest he put forth his hand,
and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever” (Gen. iii. 22); by
which is meant, would that he should do so, for the Lord loves righteousness, and
he is not a God desiring condemnation; as it is written, “As I live, saith the Lord
God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from
his way and live.” (Ezek. xxxiii. 11.) Yet it is not stated in the Scriptures that
after the fall he ever ate of the tree of life. This is, perhaps, a hint that it is
almost impossible for one who once has eaten of the tree of knowledge of good and
evil, that he should afterwards eat of the tree of life. “For the difficulty of uniting
<i>a couple</i> a second time is as great as dividing the Red Sea,” which was supernatural, although
it is indeed not impossible. Thus Solomon left the thing unexplained; and though he
mentioned how they longed for each other after their separation, and how they praised
one another in the manner of lovers, yet they are not any more found united, or to
have a nuptial couch, a palanquin, feast and joy, as a husband and wife; nay, at the
conclusion we even find the beloved reproving her, saying, “Neighbours hear thy voice,”
it being improper for a woman to let her voice be heard by young men, for there is
dishonour in a woman’s voice. He therefore asks her to let her voice be heard by him
only, and not by others. But she boldly replied, “Haste, my beloved, and be like the
gazelle or the young fawn upon the mountains of aromatics;” as if the neighbours were
her husbands, and her husband a paramour who must conceal himself, and run away, lest
they meet him.
</p>
<p>This section also is subdivided into two parts: the first is from v. 2 to viii. 5,
and the second from viii. 5, to the end of the book; the second part being epexegetical
of the first. The above is the division of the Book in accordance with the learned,
who wrote expositions on it.</p>
</blockquote><p>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb56">[<a href="#pb56">56</a>]</span></p>
<p>This union of the active with the passive intellect is represented by the sincere
and ardent attachment formed between a humble shepherd and shepherdess, the literal
history of which Immanuel beautifully explains before he attempts to palm upon it
his philosophical theory. It is of importance to notice, that this distinguished poet
also takes the hero and heroine of the plot to be a shepherd and a shepherdess, and
regards Solomon as a <i>separate</i> person, whom the rustic maiden adduces in illustration of her deep and sincere love
to her shepherd, affirming, that if this great king were to bring her into his court,
and offer her all its grandeur and luxuries, she would still rejoice in her humble
lover. The commentary contains valuable philological remarks, and excellent explanations
of some of the poetical similes. Pity it has never been published.
</p>
<p>1288–1370. Levi ben Gershon, also called Leon de Banolas and <i>Ralbag</i>, a learned and influential expositor, who was born in 1288, and died about 1370<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2640src" href="#xd31e2640">60</a>, defends the same philosophical theory. His commentary, which is very lengthy, is
published in the Amsterdam Rabbinical Bible 1724.
</p>
<p>It will be remembered, that allusion has been made by preceding commentators, to some
who rejected the allegorical interpretation, and took this book in its literal sense.
A manuscript commentary, in the possession of the Bodleian Library, Oxford, Oppenheim
Collection, No. 625, interprets <i>this Song as celebrating the virtuous love contracted between a humble shepherd and
shepherdess</i>; and likewise regards Solomon as <i>a distinct person</i>, whom the shepherdess adduces in illustration of her deep and sincere attachment
to her beloved, affirming, that if this great king were to offer her all the splendour
and luxury of his court to transfer her affections, she would spurn all, and remain
faithful to her humble shepherd.
</p>
<p>This commentary has no title-page, which renders it impossible <span class="pageNum" id="pb57">[<a href="#pb57">57</a>]</span>to ascertain the name of its author or its exact age. From the French expressions,
however, occurring in it, and from its style and appearance, it is evident that this
commentary was written by a French Jew in at least the twelfth or thirteenth century.
The handwriting is peculiarly bad, and very much effaced; but the valuable remarks
it contains, both on the verbal difficulties and poetical figures of this book, would
amply repay any Hebrew scholar for publishing it, and would be a boon to Biblical
and Hebrew literature.
</p>
<p>1350. So numerous and diverse were the interpretations of this Song in the middle
of the fourteenth century, that R. Isaac Sehula, having been solicited by his friends
to comment upon it, consulted the existing expositions, but finding himself so confused
by their conflicting theories, as <i>some explained it literally, others referred it to the union of the body with the
soul, others again expounded it according to the Medrash, and others again affirmed,
that it represents the union of the active with the passive intellect</i>, he felt it necessary to reject them all, and advanced a new theory, viz., <i>that this book represents the love of the people of Israel to their God</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2659src" href="#xd31e2659">61</a>
</p>
<p>1360–1730. For a space of about four hundred years, the battle-field was simultaneously
occupied by all the parties who strenuously defended those different views. Thus,
the commentary Shear Jashub, which was printed together with that of Saadias and Caspe,
and Meier Arma, who was born in Saragossa about the year 1475, and whose commentary
is <span class="pageNum" id="pb58">[<a href="#pb58">58</a>]</span>published in the Amsterdam Rabbinical Bible, 1724, maintain the philosophical interpretation
of this Song. Whilst Isaac Arma, the father of Meier Arma, Obadiah Sforno, a physician,
divine, and commentator, who died in 1550,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2670src" href="#xd31e2670">62</a> and whose commentary is published in the Amsterdam Rabb. Bible, Moses Cordovero,
born in 1522, and died 1570,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2673src" href="#xd31e2673">63</a> whose commentary has not been published, Abraham Levi, whose commentary has been
printed, together with that of Ibn Shoeb, Sabionnetta in Italy, <span class="sic" title="Correction: 1558">558</span>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2679src" href="#xd31e2679">64</a> Elisha Galicho, who flourished in the second half of the sixteenth century,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2693src" href="#xd31e2693">65</a> and whose commentary was published 1587, Venice, and his contemporary, Moses Alshech,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2696src" href="#xd31e2696">66</a> whose commentary was published in 1591, Venice, are the combatants for the other
views.
</p>
<p>While this severe struggle was carried on between the conflicting parties for the
maintenance of their respective views, another champion entered the battle-field,
occupying and defending another position. It was no less a personage than the celebrated
Don Isaac Abravanel, who affirmed that <i>the Bride of the Song represents Wisdom, with whom Solomon converses</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2703src" href="#xd31e2703">67</a>
</p>
<p>His son, Leon Hebræus, defended the same view.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2711src" href="#xd31e2711">68</a>
</p>
<p>1729–1786. With Moses Mendelssohn, a new era commenced in Biblical exegesis, and in
Hebrew literature generally. This distinguished philosopher translated the Song of
Songs, which was first published in Berlin, 1788, with an introduction and commentary
by his colleagues Löwe and Wolfssohn. Though they did not deem their age prepared
for the rejection of the allegorical interpretation, these commentators distinctly
stated, that <span class="pageNum" id="pb59">[<a href="#pb59">59</a>]</span>as so many of the Rabbins have written upon this book, and defended such various and
conflicting views, <i>they questioned whether any were right</i>, and affirmed that the literal explanation is paramount, and therefore confined themselves
in the commentary to the literal and philological sense, referring those who are fond
of labyrinths to the writings of Rashi, Rabe, Arma, &amp;c.
</p>
<p>Seeing that this book describes the love of a <i>shepherd</i> and a shepherdess, and also speaks of <i>a king</i>, of humble rural life, as well as of courtly splendour, and unable to account for
it, Löwe and Wolfssohn divided it into separate songs, some celebrating the love between
a shepherd and shepherdess, others describing the same between the king and his princes,
and others again not speaking of that passion at all.
</p>
<p>1798–1821. Löwisohn, born in 1798, and died in 1821, was the first who recognised
and elucidated the true design of this book. This sweet singer of modern Israel shows
that <i>the Song of Songs celebrates the victory of true and virtuous love in humble life
over the temptations of royalty</i>; that this book records the virtuous attachment of <i>a shepherdess</i> to <i>a shepherd</i>; that the rustic maiden having been tempted by the wisest and most celebrated king
to transfer her affections, spurned every allurement, and remained faithful to her
humble lover.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2740src" href="#xd31e2740">69</a>
</p>
<p>1832. It is surprising that the profound and learned Zunz,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2745src" href="#xd31e2745">70</a> did not follow up the remarks of Löwisohn; but regarded this Song as <i>an epithalamium</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2750src" href="#xd31e2750">71</a>
</p>
<p>1848. This view, however, has not gained ground among the Jews; and Dr. Salomon Herxheimer,
chief Rabbi of <span class="corr" id="xd31e2755" title="Source: Anhalt. Bernburg">Anhalt-Bernburg</span>, in his translation of the Old Testament with annotations, <span class="pageNum" id="pb60">[<a href="#pb60">60</a>]</span>follows the opinion of Löwisohn.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2760src" href="#xd31e2760">72</a> His opinion is that “<i>the Song of Songs celebrates ardent and virtuous love which resists all allurements.
The Shulamite, a rustic maiden warmly attached to a young shepherd, is taken against
her will to the court of King Solomon. The king offers everything to win her affections,
but she does not suffer herself to be dazzled either by the royal court, or by the
sweet flatteries of the king himself, and remains faithful to her absent lover.</i>”
</p>
<p>1854. Dr. Philippson, Rabbi of Magdeburg, propounded the same view.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2767src" href="#xd31e2767">73</a> <i>The design of the book is to show that true and virtuous love is invincible, and is
not to be bought, but is a flame of God</i> (Ch. viii. 6, 7), <i>exemplified in the conduct of a humble shepherdess, who being attached to a shepherd,
was tempted by King Solomon to transfer her affection, but who overcame all allurements,
and remained faithful to her lover.</i>
</p>
<p>The two last-mentioned <span class="sic" title="Correction: Rabbin">Rabbins</span>, by virtue of their high position and great learning, may be regarded as representing
the view now generally entertained by the Jews respecting the Song of Songs.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2779src" href="#xd31e2779">74</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb61">[<a href="#pb61">61</a>]</span></p>
<p>185–254. We come now to the <span class="sc">Christian Expositors</span> of this book, whom we shall introduce in the same chronological order, and of whose
views a concise explanation will be given. The first of these is Origen, who has been
justly celebrated for his genius and extensive acquirements. He was born in Alexandria
in 185, and died in Tyros in 254. His commentaries upon Scripture are very extensive,
and though containing much that is valuable, abound with fanciful allegories and inexplicable
mysteries. His attachment to the Platonic philosophy drew him aside from the simplicity
of inspired truth, and his instruction in Hebrew by R. Hillel,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2888src" href="#xd31e2888">75</a> imbued him with Hagadic interpretations of the sacred text.
</p>
<p>His commentary upon the Song of Songs was very voluminous, of which fragments only
remain, but these are of a very elaborate kind, and sufficient to reveal his whole
design. He admits an historical sense as an epithalamium on the marriage of Solomon
with Pharaoh’s daughter,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2905src" href="#xd31e2905">76</a> but in him we meet with a full exhibition of the allegorical allusion to the marriage
union of Christ and his Church, which has been adopted by the majority of expositors
to the present day. He says, “<i>Blessed is he who enters the holy place, but more blessed is he who enters the holy
of holies; blessed is he who keeps the Sabbath, but more blessed is he who keeps the
Sabbath of Sabbaths; so blessed is he who sings holy songs, but more blessed is he
who sings the Song of Songs.</i><span class="corr" id="xd31e2909" title="Not in source">”</span>
</p>
<p>He finds in it four distinct parties; a bridegroom and bride with their separate companions.
By “the bridegroom,” we are to understand <i>Christ</i>, by “the bride,” <i>the Church</i>, by “the <span class="pageNum" id="pb62">[<a href="#pb62">62</a>]</span>companions” of the former, <i>angels and saints in heaven</i>, and by “the maidens” of the latter, <i>believers on the earth</i>.
</p>
<p>The following is a specimen of Origen’s method of interpretation:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first"><a href="#v1.2">2</a>, <a href="#v1.3">3</a>. <i>Let him kiss me, &amp;c.</i> This is the suppliant voice of the bride, of which the meaning is, “How long will
my bridegroom send kisses by Moses and kisses by the Prophets? I want to touch his
lips. Let him come,” she says to the father of the bridegroom, “and give me kisses
of his mouth.” The father hears and sends his son; she seeing him near says, “<i>How good are thy breasts above wine, and the odour of thy perfumery above all sweet
spices</i>.” The bridegroom Christ, sent by the Father, comes anointed to the Spouse, who says
to him, “Thou lovest righteousness and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God,
hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.” If the odour of that
ointment be upon us, we shall become a sweet savour of Christ. Sin has putrid effluvia,
virtue breathes forth sweet perfume. The one is an emanation of the flesh, the other
of the Spirit.
</p>
<p><i>Thy name, &amp;c.</i> This is prophetic. Only so far as the name of God comes into the world is this ointment
poured forth. In the Gospel, a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment
poured it upon the head of Christ. One who was a sinner poured it upon his feet, and
one who was not a sinner poured it upon his head. These are not narratives merely,
but mysteries. It is not wonderful that the <i>house</i> was filled with the odour of the ointment, since the <i>world</i> will be. It is written in the same place concerning Simon the leper. I think the
leprous Simon to be the prince of this world, whose house at the coming of Christ
was filled with sweet odour. <i>Therefore do the virgins love thee</i>, because, through the Holy Spirit, the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts.
The maidens at first are not present, but, upon hearing a chorus from them in praise
of the bridegroom, she says, <i>The virgins love thee</i>. By their coming up it is said, ‘<i>After thee and the odour of thine ointments we will run</i>.’
</p>
<p><a href="#v1.4">4</a>. <i>Draw me, &amp;c.</i> In a race all run, but one receiveth the prize. This prize is Christ. The bride,
pure and fair, having entered into the royal apartments, returns to the maidens, and
tells them what she has seen. <i>The king hath brought me into his chambers.</i> He praises the bride. He says, Justice hath loved thee. Then the bride says to the
maidens,
</p>
<p><a href="#v1.5">5</a>. <i>Black I am, &amp;c.</i> Do not look upon me because I am blackened, for the sun hath looked upon me. How
black and without whiteness, is she beautiful? Black with sin, and comely because
converted. Because not yet purged from all sin she is called black, but her dark colour
will not remain. She is made white as she ascends to greater things, according to
ch. viii. 5. “Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved?”
Tents of Kedar, say the Hebrews, are dark: skins of Solomon, such as ornamented the
temple, were comely.</p>

</p>
<p>296–373. Athanasius, Archbishop of Alexandria, was born <span class="pageNum" id="pb63">[<a href="#pb63">63</a>]</span>in that city in 296, and died in 373. He was the principal defender of the Nicene
faith, in opposition to Arius. His zealous advocacy of the Deity of Christ led him
to seek, and to find that doctrine everywhere. He looked upon the Song of Songs <i>as a Jubilee song of the Church, at the incarnation of the Son of God</i>, and thus differs from Origen, who refers it to the experience of the believing soul.
<i>The whole book</i>, he says, <i>is an allegory, and is to be understood enigmatically from the beginning to the end.
Its doctrines are secrets, and those only who are well versed in allegory ought to
study it, as it is sure to be corrupted in the hands of others. It is called the Song
of Songs, because it is the chief and last song, and the coming of Christ in the flesh,
which other songs regard as future, this celebrates as present. It is an Epithalamium
in celebration of the marriage of Him who is the loved of God and human flesh. Here
are no threatenings and sorrows as in other books, but as the Bridegroom is present,
all is turned into joy. The book is full of dialogues between the Son of God and the
human race; sometimes between men in general and Christ, sometimes between Him and
his ancient people; sometimes between Him and the Gentile Church, sometimes between
the Gentiles and Jerusalem; and sometimes between ministering angels and men.</i>
</p>
<p>The following is a specimen of Athanasius’ Commentary:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first"><a href="#v1.2">2</a>. <i>Let him kiss me, &amp;c.</i> This is the entreaty of his ancient people to the Word, that he would descend and
take flesh; and also (ch. vii. 13), “The mandrakes give a smell, and at our gates
are all manner of pleasant fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for thee, O my
beloved,” and (ch. viii. 1), “Oh, that thou wert as my brother that sucked the breasts
of my mother,” which refers to Christ being of the same nature as man, a brother,
and yet in reality having a mother only. In ch. v. 1, Christ speaks of his having
become incarnate, “I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse; I have gathered
my myrrh with my spices.” The world is his garden, because it is his creation; and
his body breathes forth fragrance, because it is joined to the Divine word. The Word
having put on flesh, he calls his ancient people to Him, and says (ch. ii. 10–13),
“Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come, for lo, the winter is past, &amp;c.” His first
disciples would recognise in his teaching what they had long been listening for, “the
voice of the turtle in their land.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb64">[<a href="#pb64">64</a>]</span></p>
<p>In this fanciful manner our author descants upon the whole book.
</p>
<p>331–396. Notwithstanding the authority and influence of the foregoing fathers, the
allegorical interpretation was rejected by many at a very early age. And Gregory,
bishop of Nyssa, in Cappadocia, born about 331, and died about 396, who wrote an extensive
commentary upon this book, had strenuously to contend for the allegorical or spiritual
interpretation, and severely condemned those who adhered to the literal meaning. The
soul, he considers, as a spouse who enters into spiritual union with God. The most
perfect and blessed way of salvation is here shown to those who wish to come to the
knowledge of the truth.
</p>
<p>The following is a specimen of Gregory’s Commentary:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first"><a href="#v1.2">2</a>. <i>Let him kiss me, &amp;c.</i>, is the language of the soul to God, which has become worthy to speak to God face
to face. <i>Thy breasts are better than wine</i>, that is, divine breasts are better than human wine. All human wisdom cannot equal
the milk of the divine word.
</p>
<p><a href="#v1.3">3</a>. <i>Thy name, &amp;c.</i> This signifies that all the virtues are nothing to the graces received from above.</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>Thus he finds some spiritual meaning in every part, for the confirmation of which
some other part of Scripture is adduced.
</p>
<p>331–420. Jerome, however, (born at Stridon in Dalmatia in 331, and died in the vicinity
of Bethlehem in 420,) who was exceedingly fond of the Greek philosophers, and, like
Origen, was instructed in Hebrew literature by the Jews,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3010src" href="#xd31e3010">77</a> as might have been expected, was not affected by the objections against the allegorical
interpretation, but introduced it into the Western Churches. According to him, it
is a nuptial and dramatic song on the occasion of the union of Christ with his Church
or the soul of man. The bride and her companions, and the bridegroom and his companions
are the interlocutors <span class="pageNum" id="pb65">[<a href="#pb65">65</a>]</span>in the drama. He seems to have embraced almost entirely the theory and interpretation
of Origen.
</p>
<p>354–430. Augustin, who was born at Tagesta in Numidia, in 354, and died in 430, materially
aided Jerome in the spread of the allegorical interpretation in the West. He regards
the Song of Songs as describing “<i>the holy loves of Christ and his Church</i>.”
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Of ch. i. 7, “Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest thy flock, where,”
&amp;c., he says it is one testimony in behalf of the church in Africa, which lies in
the meridian of the world. The church asks Christ to tell her where the one true church
is, where it feeds and reclines. The bridegroom answers, In the meridian, I feed in
the meridian, I recline in the meridian. The church is in other parts, but in Africa
is its meridian. This is the language of believers out of Africa, who also say, “For
why should I be as one roaming among the flocks of thy companions?” that is, why remain
concealed and unknown? Other churches are not thy flock, but the flocks of thy companions.
Upon the adjuration, “I adjure you,” &amp;c. vii. 7, he observes, The church in these
words addresses her own daughters. She is a field of God, fruitful in graces, to which
by loving Christ the martyrs come, whom he wishes to lay down their lives as lovingly
as he laid down his life for them. Ch. ii. 15. “Take us the foxes,” &amp;c., that is,
withstand, confute, subdue, heretics that injure the ecclesiastical vines. Bind them
by Scripture testimony, as Samson bound the foxes together, and put fire to their
tails, by warning them of the condemnation they have deserved. In ch. iv. 16, “Awake,
O north, and come, thou south wind,” &amp;c., he says, the north wind is from the cold
icy regions of the devil and his angels, and the south wind is the spirit of grace
blowing at noon from warm and shining regions, that cause the spices to flow out,
as the apostle says, “We are unto God a sweet savour of Christ in them that are saved,
and in them that perish.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>360–429. Theodore, bishop of Mopsuestia, who wrote a commentary on this book, also
rejected the allegorical meaning, and adhered to its literal and obvious sense. Pity
that his commentary is lost, and that the only account of it is from his enemies.
</p>
<p>386–457. So general was the dissatisfaction with the allegorical interpretation of
the Song of Songs, and so different were the theories respecting it at the time of
Theodoret or Theodorit, bishop of Cyrus in Syria, who was born at Antioch about 386,
and died 457, that he was obliged to mention and refute them.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb66">[<a href="#pb66">66</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>There are some</i>, says this prelate, <i>who do not admit that the Song of Songs has a spiritual sense, and make of it such
a texture of fables, which is unbecoming even to the insane. Some maintain that Solomon
is here celebrating himself and the daughter of Pharaoh; others take the Shulamite,
not as Pharaoh’s daughter, but as Abishag; and others, again, considering the thing
with a little more reverence, call this book a Royal address, and take “the bride,”
to be the people of Israel, and “the bridegroom” the king. I have, therefore, found
it necessary, before proceeding with the interpretation, first, to refute this false
and pernicious interpretation, and then to fix the obvious design of this book.</i>
</p>
<p>1. <i>These people</i>, he submits, <i>ought to remember that those holy fathers were much wiser, and had more spiritual
minds than they had, that this book was incorporated in the sacred writings, and that
the Church revered it for its spiritual meaning, &amp;c.</i>
</p>
<p>2. <i>Through Manasseh and the destruction of Jerusalem, the writings of the Old Testament
were lost, but the Holy Spirit restored them to Ezra by inspiration. Now the Holy
Spirit could not have inspired any other than a divine book.</i>
</p>
<p>3. <i>Because the holy fathers saw this, they have either written devotional commentaries
on the entire book, or filled their writings with its thoughts, as for instance, Eusebius
and others, who were near the apostolic age. Now, are we not to believe these holy
fathers? not believe the Holy Ghost? not obey the voice of God rather than our own
opinions? We must so deal with the sacred Scriptures as not to regard letters merely,
but draw out the hidden spirit from obscurity.</i>
</p>
<p>“The bridegroom” <i>is Christ</i>, “the bride” <i>his church</i>; “the daughters of Jerusalem” <i>are pious, but still unfinished souls (young in a Christian sense), which have not
as yet attained the perfection of the bride, but imitate her example</i>; “the companions of the bridegroom” <i>are either the angels or the prophets</i>.
</p>
<p>The following is a specimen of his commentary:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first"><a href="#v1.1">1</a>. <i>The Song of Songs, &amp;c.</i> This book is called The Song of Songs, because all other songs in the writings of
Moses, the Prophets, and Psalms <span class="pageNum" id="pb67">[<a href="#pb67">67</a>]</span>are made for this song, which is not amatory, but a song about the marriage of the
Divine Bridegroom with the Church.
</p>
<p><a href="#v1.2">2</a>. <i>Let him kiss me, &amp;c.</i> This is the language of the spouse offering a petition to the Father of the Bridegroom;
for she has known both the promises made to Abraham and the prophecies of Jacob; as
well as the prophecies of Moses, respecting her beloved, and the description of his
beauty and power as given in the Psalms; “Thou art more beautiful than the sons of
men,” &amp;c.; she has learned that her beloved, who is adorned with beauty and grace,
is both God and the eternal Son; “For thy throne, Oh God, is for ever and ever,” &amp;c.
Having recognised the beauty, strength, riches, dominion, and power of the bridegroom
which he displays above all things, world without end, she draws nigh to him to embrace
him and to kiss him in Spirit. Let none whose spirit is low, and who only tastes that
which is earthly, be misled by the expression “kisses.” Let him remember that we ourselves
embrace and kiss the limbs of the beloved at the mysterious time (the Lord’s Supper),
and that which we see with our eyes, store up in our hearts, and, as it were, feel
ourselves in conjugal embraces; so that it is with us as if we were with him, embracing
and kissing him, after, as the Scriptures say, “love has driven away fear.” Therefore
it is that the Bride wishes to be kissed by the Bridegroom himself.</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>390–444. Cyril of Alexandria, who was born towards the close of the fourth century,
and died in 444, went so far as to explain “the palanquin,” to mean <i>the cross</i>; its “silver legs,” the <i>thirty pieces of silver</i> which brought Christ to the cross; the “purple cushion,” <i>the purple garment</i> in which the Saviour was mocked; “the nuptial crown,” <i>the crown of thorns</i> put on Christ’s head, &amp;c. &amp;c.
</p>
<p>650. The influence of the Chaldee mode of interpretation seems now to become more
apparent in the Christian Church. Aponius, who is quoted by the venerable Bede, and
must therefore have lived in the seventh century, regards the Song of Songs as <i>describing what the Logos has done for the Church from the beginning of the world,
and what he will do to the end of it</i>; thus, like the Chaldee, he takes the book as a historico-prophetical description
of the dealings of God with his people, only that the Chaldee takes the Jews as the
object of the description, but Aponius substitutes the Gentile Church.
</p>
<p>673–735. Bede, called the <i>venerable</i>, who was born at Wearmouth, in Durham, in 673, and died in 735, wrote seven books
on the Song of Songs, one being merely a copy from <span class="pageNum" id="pb68">[<a href="#pb68">68</a>]</span>Gregory the Great, in which he defends the doctrine of grace against the Pelagians.
</p>
<p>1091–1153. To the scholastics of the middle ages the Song of Songs seemed an unfathomable
abyss of mysticism, into whose depths they could dive as deeply as their speculative
minds and fertile imaginations prompted them. St. Bernard, who was born at Fountains,
in the vicinity of Dijon, in Burgundy, and died in 1153, delivered <i>eighty-six</i> sermons upon this book, and this prodigious number comprises the first two chapters
only. In the first sermon he says, “<i>The unction and experience can alone teach the understanding of such a Song. It is
not to be heard outside, for its notes give no sound in the street; but she who sings
it, she hears it and he to whom it is sung, that is the bridegroom and the bride.</i>” He divides the Song into <i>three parts</i>; in the first part the bridegroom leads the bride into <i>the garden</i>, and in the second he conducts her into <i>the cellar</i>, and in the third he takes her home into <i>his apartments</i>. Upon the words <i>Let him kiss me</i>, &amp;c. (Chap. i. 2), which he explains as referring to the incarnation of Christ, he
remarks, “<i>O happy kiss, marvellous because of amazing condescension; not that mouth is pressed
upon mouth, but God is united with man</i>.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3119src" href="#xd31e3119">78</a>
</p>
<p>Gilbert Porretanus, the disciple of St. Bernard, continued these sermons, but only
lived to deliver <i>forty-eight</i>, which extend to Chap. v. 10; so that the one hundred and thirty-four sermons only
comprise <i>four chapters and a half</i>.
</p>
<p>1270–1340. In the Commentary of the celebrated Nicolas De Lyra, a converted Jew, and
a native of Lire, in Normandy, we meet more fully the Chaldee mode of interpretation
as adopted by Aponius. Like the Chaldee, De Lyra takes the Song of Songs to be a historico-prophetical
book, with this difference, however, that he regards Chap. ii.–vii. as describing
the history of the Israelites from their Exodus from Egypt to the birth of Christ,
and from Chapter vii. to the end, <i>the origin <span class="pageNum" id="pb69">[<a href="#pb69">69</a>]</span>of the Christian Church, her progress, and the peace which she attained in the days
of Constantine</i>. Upon the words, “<i>We have a little sister</i>,” he remarks, “<i>This is the Church humble and abject among the worldly enemies, for so she was till
the time of Constantine</i>.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3139src" href="#xd31e3139">79</a>
</p>
<p>1538. The great reformer, Luther, could not reconcile his mind to believe that the
Song of Songs describes the conjugal union of Christ, the bridegroom, with the bride,
<i>i.e.</i> the Church as a whole, or with the soul of every individual believer. He therefore
rejected the allegorical interpretation of the Fathers, and advanced a new theory,
viz., “<i>that the bride is the happy and peaceful State under the dominion of Solomon, and
that the Song is a hymn of praise, in which Solomon thanks God for the obedience rendered
unto him as a divine gift: for, where the Lord does not direct and rule there is neither
obedience nor happy dominion, but where there is obedience or a happy dominion there
the Lord lives and kisses and embraces his bride with his word, and that is the kisses
of his mouth</i>.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3154src" href="#xd31e3154">80</a>
</p>
<p>1542. John Brentius, the Suabian reformer, adopted the same theory. He calls the Song
of Songs<span class="corr" id="xd31e3160" title="Source: .">,</span> “<i lang="la">Carmen encomiasticum, quod de laude regni et politiae suae Solomon conscripsit</i>.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3166src" href="#xd31e3166">81</a>
</p>
<p>1544. Castellio, seeing that Luther had rejected the allegorical interpretation of
the Fathers, and propounded a theory of his own equally untenable, maintained that
the book has no allegorical meaning whatever, but is merely a “<i lang="la">colloquium Salomonis cum amica quadam Sulamitha</i>,” and as such deemed it unworthy of a place in the sacred canon.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3174src" href="#xd31e3174">82</a>
</p>
<p>1585. Thomas Wilcocks adhered to the opinion that this book celebrates the marriage
between Christ and his Church, and especially “<i>the great love of the bridegroom to his spouse, which is never removed, but always
abideth constant, how oft <span class="pageNum" id="pb70">[<a href="#pb70">70</a>]</span>soever she fall away, and seem, as a man would say, to forsake her husband</i>.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3184src" href="#xd31e3184">83</a> This commentary, which is rare, contains many useful remarks.
</p>
<p>1600. Thomas Brightman, however, adopted the view of Aponius and De Lyra, that <i>this book describes historico-prophetically, the condition of the Church</i>, and “agrees well-nigh in all things with the Revelation of St. John.” Solomon, in
this Song, and John, in the Apocalypse, “foresaw the same events in like times, and
either of them directed his course to the same mark.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3191src" href="#xd31e3191">84</a> He divides the book into two parts; the first, chap. i.–iv. 6, describes <i>the condition of the Legal Church</i> from the time of David to the death of Christ; and the second, chap. iv. 7–viii.
14, <i>the state of the Evangelical Church</i>, from <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 34 to the second coming of Christ. We give the following analysis of this curious
commentary.
</p>

Justin, Tertullian, and Cyprian.
</p>
<p>Chap. iv. 12–v. 16, describes the decayed state of the Church from 334–1510; 12, the

</p>
<p>As Brightman’s Commentary may be regarded as the fullest development of the Chaldee
interpretation Christianized, we shall give a few specimens of his mode of exposition.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first"><i>I sleep, but my heart</i>, &amp;c. chap. v. 1.—The negligence of the Church lying thus is declared first by her
drowsiness, then by his enticing call, and lastly by the slight causes of her excuse.
Sleep caused her outward senses to be benumbed, that she neither regarded nor considered
how superstitions arose, as it happened to the householder in Matt. xiii. 25. Neither
could it be otherwise (when the bridegroom left the garden and his friends or fellows
drunken with prosperity, wholly gaping after riches and honours, all common good despised),
but sleep would overcome the spouse, wherein outwardly she should not differ from
a dead woman, however the heart should move and live, the seed of faith not altogether
quenched. This drowsiness crept in, in the time of Constantine, when a gaping heaviness,
with a continued desire of sleeping, so oppressed the spouse, that the sharpest-sighted
pastors could not use their outward senses: not perceiving how ambition crept in among
the bishops, and not only that, but how they began to consecrate temples to saints,
earnestly to seek their reliques, to worship them with prayers, and to believe that
prayers made in the honour of saints at their sepulchres did profit much. Who could
now tell whether the Church were sleeping or waking? who neither loathed nor perceived
such things. When Constantine was dead, Christ found the Church asleep, and sought
by all means to stir her up both by knocking and calling. He knocked by persecutions
in the times of Constance, Julian and Valens, of whom though Julian were a professed
enemy, (<span class="asc">A.D.</span> 368,) yet the other two exceeded him in cruelty. After their tyrannous reign God
stirred up Valentinian in the west parts, by whom Christ lovingly called his spouse,
that, returning unto her former integrity, she should open and let him in. Then taking
away Valens, he called more earnestly at both doors (as it were) as well in the west
as in the east, by Gratian and Theodosius the elder; after by Arcadius and Honorius,
then by Theodosius the younger, and Valentinian the third. And lastly, (that there
might be four pair as it were answerable to the four voices, <i>my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled one</i>,) by Marcion alone in the east. These emperors studied and laboured very religiously
to defend and enlarge true religion; but the Church was in all the fault, who having
these helps <span class="pageNum" id="pb74">[<a href="#pb74">74</a>]</span>prepared, would not use them to recover her former brightness. To this readiness of
the emperors was added the voice of the most excellent bishops, and best learned men
of that time; as Basil, Gregory Nazianzen, Ambrose, Hierome, Chrysostome, Augustine
and others, the lights of that time. But seeing his profession of love could nothing
move her, he tried what his shutting out of the doors at night would do.
</p>
<p><i>My head is filled with dew</i>, &amp;c.—The locks of hair signified, before the congregation of the faithful, among
whom true religion was now so much deranged by new and foolish ceremonies, borrowed
partly of the Jews and Gentiles, and partly invented of their own idle brains, that
the grass is scarce more covered with drops of dew in the night, than the Church was
at that time with superstitions.
</p>
<p>14. <i>His hands are as gold rings</i>, &amp;c.—Hitherto hath the bridegroom been set forth to the world in some special members,
from Frederick the second to Robertus Gallus by almost 100 years. The hands are the
instruments of action, and in scripture they figuratively signify works. The gems
included in the rings seem to signify the ministers of the word, which elsewhere Christ
carried as stars in his right hand (Rev. i. 20). But these times yielded not such
splendour. These things show a change and alteration of that which Christ would bring
to pass by the labour of his ministers, as it happened about the year 1300, which
was called <i>the first resurrection of the dead</i>. For now the thousand years were ended wherein Satan was bound, and the dead raised
from their graves. Very many began now more boldly to set forth the truth, as Dante
the Florentine, Marsilius Patavinus, William <span class="corr" id="xd31e3273" title="Source: Ockam">Ockham</span>, John of Gaunt, and many others. Philip the French king despised Pope Boniface, Lewis
of Bavaria strove long time with these most humble servants of servants for the rights
of the empire. Edward of England made show unto many how little he esteemed the pope’s
authority.
</p>
<p><i>His belly is as bright ivory</i>, &amp;c.—By the belly or bowels, bright as ivory overlaid with sapphires, may be understood
the two Sacraments. For the word of God is open to the view of every one, as the mouth
and countenance, neither is it wont to be hid from strangers; but the Sacraments serve
only for the household, as the bowels, which are appointed only to that body whose
members they are, but serve to no use for strangers. These things therefore as it
were, with the finger, point to those times of John Wickliff (1370), who taught openly,
<i>that the substance of the material bread and wine remains in the sacrament of the
altar; the accidents of bread remain not without the subject in the same Sacrament;
Christ is not really in the Sacrament, in proper presence corporally</i>. Berengarius spoke against this wicked error 200 years before, but the time was not
yet come wherein the hands of the bridegroom should be seen full of rings, whence
his empire wanted success.</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>How different to this is the opinion of Henry Ainsworth, the celebrated Nonconformist
divine, who regards this “book as treating of man’s reconciliation unto God, and peace
by Jesus <span class="pageNum" id="pb75">[<a href="#pb75">75</a>]</span>Christ, with joy in the Holy Spirit!” “In Solomon’s days,” says Ainsworth, “the Church
before Christ’s coming had the greatest glory, having the temple builded, living under
that most wise, rich, and peaceable King; the Israelites being as the sand which is
by the sea in multitude, eating, and drinking, and making merry, and dwelling safely,
every man under his vine and under his fig-tree.” (1 Kings iv. 10, 25.) Notwithstanding
Solomon, being a prophet, foresaw the ruin of his house and kingdom, and in his book
of Ecclesiastes proclaimed all things under the sun to be vanity, and <i>in this Song prophesieth of the Church and Kingdom of Christ. And as he, with many
other prophets, and kings, and righteous men, desired to see Christ, and to hear his
words, but did not</i> (Luke x. 24; Matt. xiii. 7), <i>so here he manifesteth the desire of himself and of all the faithful to enjoy the
blessings and graces of Christ, saying, ‘Let him kiss me.’ Whereby the Church desireth
to have Christ manifested in the flesh, and to have the loving and comfortable doctrines
of his Gospel applied unto her conscience, that she might not be always under the
schoolmaster of the law, which worketh wrath</i> (Rom. iv. 15), <i>but might be prevented with the grace of Christ, and have the feeling of his love
towards her.</i><span id="xd31e3291"></span><a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3292src" href="#xd31e3292">85</a>
</p>
<p>The difference of opinion respecting the interpretation of this book, which obtained
after the Reformation had laid open the Scriptures to all Protestants, and had established
the right of private judgment, did not, however, as yet affect the Romish Church.
Her followers not only adhered to the allegorical interpretation, but, unlike their
predecessors of the middle ages, took the bride of the Song to be <i>the Virgin Mary</i>. Thus Michael Ghislerius and Cornelius à Lapide. The latter is especially to be noticed,
since he was the first who endeavoured to show that this Song is <i>a drama in five acts</i>.
</p>
<p>1583–1645. The fact, that the allegorical interpretation <span class="pageNum" id="pb76">[<a href="#pb76">76</a>]</span>could with equal facility be made to describe the history of the Jewish nation and
that of the Virgin Mary, awakened the suspicion of Hugo Grotius, the celebrated statesman,
philosopher, and divine. He, therefore, adhered to the literal sense of the book,
which, according to him, <i>celebrates the marriage of Solomon with Pharaoh’s daughter</i>, but at the same time also admitted <i>that the</i> <span class="asc">ARCANA NUPTIARUM</span> spiritually represent, <i>first, the love of God to the Israelites, and then the love of Christ to the Church</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3315src" href="#xd31e3315">86</a> It will be remembered that Origen was already of opinion that this Song primarily
celebrates the marriage of Solomon with Pharaoh’s daughter, though with him the literal
meaning was of no importance, and that Theodoret mentions some who viewed the Song
in no other light than this.
</p>
<p>1603–1699. It was to be expected that John Cocceius, the founder of the theological
school bearing his name, whose doctrine was, that the whole history of the Old Testament
is a mirror, accurately reflecting the transactions and events that were to happen
under the New Testament dispensation to the end of the world, would find in this Song
something in accordance with his views. Enlarging upon Aponius’ and De Lyra’s mode
of interpretation, and, like Brightman, still more approaching the Chaldee, in a manner
peculiar to himself Cocceius <i>regards this book as a prophetical narrative of the transactions and events that are
to happen in the Church</i>, and divides the whole into seven distinct periods, similar to the seven trumpets
and seven seals in the Revelation of St. John.

<p>1648. Strange as this mode of interpretation may appear, yet, as we have seen, it
is not confined to a single individual or country. John Cotton also affirms that Solomon
in this book “<i>describes the estate of the Church towards Christ, and his respect towards her from
his</i> (<i>i.e.</i> Solomon’s) <i>own time to the last judgment</i>.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3422src" href="#xd31e3422">88</a>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Chap. i. describes the estate of the Church from the days of Solomon to the repair
of the temple by Josiah. </li>
<li>Chap. ii. describes the estate of the Church from the repair of the temple to the
days of the Maccabees. </li>
<li>Chap. iii. describes the estate of the Church from the days of the Maccabees to the
time of Christ’s sojourning here on earth. </li>
<li>Chap. iv. describes the estate of the Church—first, in Christ’s time, under his ministry,
ver. 1–6; secondly, after his ascension, under the Apostles, ver. 7–11; thirdly, after
their departure, during the first ten persecutions, ver. 12–16. </li>
<li>Chap. v. describes the estate of the Church from the time that Constantine entered
it to the time of restoring <span class="pageNum" id="pb78">[<a href="#pb78">78</a>]</span>the Gospel and reforming of the Church by the ministry of Luther and other late divines.
</li>
<li>Chap. vi. describes the state of the Church reformed by the ministry of Luther and
other late divines, and the calling in of the Jews. </li>
<li>Chap. vii.–viii. 4, describes the estate of the Jewish Church when they shall come
to be converted unto the Lord. </li>
<li>Chap. viii. 5–14, describes the solicitude which the Church of Judea and Assyria cherished
for the growth and establishment of the good people in Egypt, the destruction of the
Turks, the union of all Christians, the coming of the Lord, &amp;c. </li>
</ul><p>
</p>
<p>1650. John Trapp, however, adhered to the more general view, and regarded this Song
as “<i>a treasury of the most sacred and highest mysteries of Holy Scriptures, streaming
out all along, under the parable of a marriage, that full torrent of spiritual love
that is betwixt Christ and the Church</i>.” … “The form of it is dramatical and dialogistical; the chief speakers are, not
<i>Solomon</i> and the <i>Shulamite</i>, as Castellio makes it, but Christ and his Church. Christ also hath associates (those
friends of the bridegroom), viz., the prophets, apostles, pastors, and teachers, who
put in a word sometimes; as likewise do the fellow-friends of the bride, viz. whole
churches or particular Christians.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3446src" href="#xd31e3446">89</a>
</p>
<p>1688. Hennischius not only adopted the view of Brightman and Cocceius, but even exceeded
it, and called his commentary upon this book,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3451src" href="#xd31e3451">90</a> “<i>The Apocalypse in the Canticles</i>.” He found in the Song of Songs seven periods of the Church described, answerable
to the states of the seven Asiatic Churches in the Revelation of St. John.

Bishop, would not allow him to follow these extravagant theories. Presuming that the
marriage of Solomon with the daughter of Pharaoh is the primary object of this Song,
and that the nuptial feast among the Jews was hebdomadal, Bossuet divides the poem
into seven parts, corresponding to the seven days of the supposed duration of the
wedding.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3567src" href="#xd31e3567">91</a> The following is his division:—

<p>1700. Bishop Patrick, however, would not admit any literal meaning, but found, almost
in every word, some delightful mystery. Even the words, “Thy navel is like a round
goblet which wanteth not liquor; thy belly is like a heap of wheat set about with
lilies,” (chap. vii. 2,) at which so much umbrage has been taken, this pious prelate
says, may mean “<i>the</i> <span class="sc">two Sacraments</span> <i>which the Church administers to her children</i>; <span class="sc">the Font in Baptism</span> <i>being represented by the former, and</i> <span class="sc">the Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper</span> <i>by the other part of the figure</i>.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3633src" href="#xd31e3633">92</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb80">[<a href="#pb80">80</a>]</span></p>
<p>1710. Shortly after the publication of this commentary appeared the Exposition of
Matthew Henry. And though Henry confessed, “on the one hand, that if he who barely
reads this book be asked, as the eunuch was, <i>Understandest thou what thou readest?</i> he will have more reason than he had to say, <i>How can I, except some man shall guide me?</i> that the books of Scripture history and prophecy are very much like one another,
but that this Song of Solomon is very much unlike the Songs of his father David; here
is not the name of God in it; it is never quoted in the New Testament; we find not
in it any expressions of natural religion or pious devotion; no, nor is it introduced
by vision, or any of the marks of immediate revelation; thus it seems as hard as any
part of Scripture to be made <i>a savour of life unto life</i>.” Yet he affirms, “on the other hand, that with the help of the many faithful guides
we have for the understanding of this book, <i>it appears to be a very bright and powerful ray of heavenly light, admirably fitted
to excite pious and devout affections in holy souls, to draw out their desires towards
God, to increase their delight in him, and improve their acquaintance and communion
with him</i>.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3650src" href="#xd31e3650">93</a>
</p>
<p>1723. Durham tells us the import of the Song of Songs much more positively and dogmatically
than either Patrick or Henry. “<i>The great scope of this Song is to set out that mutual love and carriage that is between
Christ and the Church in five distinct branches. It holdeth out the Church’s case,
and Christ’s care of her, in all her several conditions, and under all dispensations;
such as</i>, I. <i>Her sinful infirmities, and failings in duties</i>, chap. i. 6; v. 2, 3, <i>and also under liveliness in duties</i>, chap. i. 2, 3, 4, and v. 5, <i>and almost throughout</i>. II. <i>Under crosses</i>, chap. i. 6, <i>as being ‘a lily among thorns,’ and hated of the world</i>, ii. 2, <i>and also in prosperity, wherein she is commended as terrible</i>, vi. 10. III. <i>As deserted and sick of love</i>, chap. iii. 1, 2, and v. 4, 5, <i>and again as enjoying her beloved</i>, i. 4; iii. 4, 5. IV. <i>As under faithful shepherds and lively ordinances</i>, chap. i. 4; iii. 4, 5, <i>and also <span class="pageNum" id="pb81">[<a href="#pb81">81</a>]</span>as under carnal watchmen</i>, v. 7. <i>And in all these, her various conditions, in all ages, are painted forth, before Christ’s
incarnation, as well as now, without respect to any particular time or age; for ceremonial
things are not here meddled with, but what was spiritual; besides the Church then
and now is one, as in the next consideration will be cleared.</i> V. <i>As in private dealing with Christ, and longing after him and praying for him</i>, chap. iv. 16; viii. 1, <i>and almost throughout, and also what she was in public duties, going to the watchmen</i>, chap. v. 7, and iii. 3, <i>and what she was in fellowship with others</i>, v. 8, 9; vi. 1, 2. VI. <i>It sets out believers as more strong, and it furnishes a greater measure of grace
and knowledge; and also, as more weak in gifts and grace.</i> VII. <i>And lastly, it holds forth the same believers as more and less lively in their conditions.</i>
</p>
<p>“<i>This book, in its matter, is a comprehensive sum of all those particulars formed in
a song, put together, and drawn as on a board, for the believers’ edification, to
show</i>, 1. <i>What should be, and will be their carriage, when it is right with them as to their
frame.</i> 2. <i>What are their infirmities, and what they use often to fall into, even they who are
believers, that they may be the more watchful.</i> 3. <i>To shew what they meet with, that they may make for sufferings, and not stumble at
them when they come.</i> 4. <i>That the care and love of Christ to them, in reference to all these, may appear, that
they may know upon what grounds to comfort themselves in every condition, and may
have this Song as a little magazine, for direction and consolation in every condition.</i>”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3707src" href="#xd31e3707">94</a>
</p>
<p>Upon the words “Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines,” &amp;c. (Chap.
ii. 15), Durham remarks:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“This fifteenth verse contains the last part of Christ’s Sermon; wherein, as he had
formerly given directions in reference to her particular walk, so here he evidenceth
his care of her external peace. That Christ speaks these words, the continuation and
series of them with the former, the scope (which is to make full proof of his case),
and the manner how the duty here mentioned is laid on, to wit, by way of authority,
makes it clear. <span class="pageNum" id="pb82">[<a href="#pb82">82</a>]</span>There are three things in them, 1. On external evil incident to the Church, and that
is, to be spoiled by ‘<i>foxes</i>.’ 2. A care given in a direction, ‘<i>Take them</i>,’ &amp;c. 3. He gives reasons to deter all from cruel pity in sparing of them, ‘<i>For</i>,’ &amp;c.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>Having descanted at large upon the first and second heads, Durham remarks on the third:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“<i>Thirdly.</i> There is a motive to press, implied, while he (i.e. Christ) saith this; ‘<i>Take us</i>,’ which words insinuate that it is service both to him and her, and that ministers
are his servants, and the Church’s for Christ’s sake. It shows also his sympathy in
putting himself, as it were, in hazard with her (at least mystically considered),
and his love in comforting her, that he thinks himself concerned in the restraint
of these foxes as well as she is.
</p>
<p>“<i>Fourthly.</i> The direction is amplified, to remove an objection (say some) ‘All heresies, or all
heretics are not equal; some comparatively are little to be regarded, and it is cruelty
to meddle with these, that seem to profess fair.’ ‘<i>No</i> (saith he), <i>take them all, even</i> <span class="asc">THE LITTLE FOXES</span>; <i>for though they be but little, yet they are foxes; though they be not of the grossest
kind</i> (as all scandals in fact are not alike, yet none is to be dispensed with), <i>so they are</i> (saith he) <i>foxes, and corrupt others; for a little leaven will leaven the whole lump</i> (often small-like schisms, or heresies, such as the <i>Novations</i> and <i>Donatists</i>, &amp;c., have been exceedingly defacing to the beauty of the Church), <i>therefore</i>, saith he, <i>hunt and take them up</i>.’ How small a friend is our Lord to toleration! and how displeased is he with many
errors, that the world thinks little of! Magistrates, ministers and people may learn
here, what distance ought to be kept with the spreaders of the least errors; and how
every one ought to concur, in their stations, for preventing the hurt that comes by
them.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3760src" href="#xd31e3760">95</a></p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>1723. Whether this commentary, with its affirmation that “this Song is a little magazine,
for direction and consolation in every condition,” and whether the doctrine of intolerance
palmed upon Chap. ii. 15 of the Song were published in time to be seen by Whiston,
who was neither convinced by Durham’s arguments nor daunted by his appeal to the magistrates,
ministers, and people; or whether they appeared too late to be seen by him, I cannot
tell. But, in the same year that Durham’s commentary was published Whiston’s Essay
appeared, in which he declares that he finds in the Song of Solomon, “<i>from the beginning to the end marks of folly, vanity, and looseness</i>,” and assures us that “<i>it was written by Solomon when he was wicked <span class="pageNum" id="pb83">[<a href="#pb83">83</a>]</span>and foolish, and lascivious and idolatrous</i>,”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3774src" href="#xd31e3774">96</a> and that the sooner this immoral book is rejected from the sacred canon the better.
</p>
<p>1728. About five years afterwards appeared the bulky Exposition of Dr. Gill on Solomon’s
Song, consisting of one hundred and twenty-two sermons, which the Doctor delivered
to his congregation. In this confused mass of accumulated learning Gill warmly refutes
both Whiston and others who had written against this book. He acknowledges “the profit
and advantage” which he had received from “the sweet observations of the excellent
Durham,” and affirms that this divine poem is wholly allegorical; “<i>and sets forth in a most striking manner the mutual love, union and communion, which
are between Christ and his Church; also expresses the several different frames, cases,
and circumstances which attend believers in this life, so that they can come into
no state or condition, but there is something in this Song suited to their experience;
which serves much to recommend it to believers, and discovers the excellency of it</i>.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3781src" href="#xd31e3781">97</a> In vain do we look even here for an exposition based upon the sound rules of grammar
and philology.
</p>
<p>1753. It was reserved for Bishop Lowth to commence in this country a new era in the
interpretation of this book. Two of his admirable “Lectures on the Sacred Poetry of
the Hebrews” are devoted to the investigation of the import and interpretation of
this Song, and the conclusion he arrived at is almost the same as that of Grotius
and Bossuet. “The subject of the Canticles,” says this learned Prelate, “appears to
be the marriage-feast of Solomon, (who was, both in name and reality, the Prince of
Peace); his bride is called Shulamite.… Who this wife of Solomon was, is not clearly
ascertained; but some of the learned have conjectured, with an appearance of probability,
that she was the daughter of Pharaoh, to whom Solomon was <span class="pageNum" id="pb84">[<a href="#pb84">84</a>]</span>known to be particularly attached. May we not, therefore, with some shadow of reason,
suspect that, under the allegory of Solomon choosing a wife from the Egyptians, might
be darkly typified that other Prince of Peace, who was to espouse a church chosen
from among the Gentiles?”
</p>
<p>As to the explanation of the allegory, this learned prelate properly advises, “that
we ought to be cautious of carrying the figurative application too far, and of entering
into a precise explication of every particular; as these minute investigations are
seldom conducted with sufficient prudence not to offend the serious part of mankind,
learned as well as unlearned.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3791src" href="#xd31e3791">98</a>
</p>
<p>Bishop Lowth also takes this poem to be of a dramatic form, and adopts the division
of Bossuet into seven parts.
</p>
<p>1764. The excellent and judicious remarks of Lowth were followed by an elegant version
of Solomon’s Song, with a brief Commentary and Annotations, by Thomas Percy, <abbr title="Doctor Divinitatis">D.D.</abbr>, Bishop of Dromore. The author vindicates the theory of Grotius, Lowth, &amp;c., that
this poem literally describes the nuptials of Solomon; and, like Bossuet and Lowth,
divides it into seven parts, answering to the seven days of the supposed duration
of the nuptials, which are distinguished from each other by different solemnities.
In terms, even more severe than those of Bishop Lowth, Percy censures those commentators,
“who have been so busily employed in opening and unfolding the allegorical meaning
of this book as wholly to neglect that literal sense which ought to be the basis of
their discoveries. If a sacred allegory may be defined a figurative discourse, which,
under a lower and more obvious meaning, delivers the most sublime and important truths;
then it is the first duty of an expositor to ascertain the lower and more obvious
meaning. For till this is done, it is impossible to discover what truths are couched
under it. Without this all is vague and idle conjecture. It is erecting an edifice
without a foundation, which, <span class="pageNum" id="pb85">[<a href="#pb85">85</a>]</span>however fair and goodly to the view, will be blown down by the slightest breath of
true criticism.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3802src" href="#xd31e3802">99</a>
</p>
<p>1765. Wesley, however, opposed this theory. He maintained that “the description of
this bridegroom and bride is such as could not with decency be used or meant concerning
<i>Solomon</i> and <i>Pharaoh’s</i> daughter; that many expressions and descriptions, if applied to them, would be absurd
and monstrous; and that it therefore follows that this book is to be understood allegorically,
concerning that spiritual love and marriage which is between Christ and his Church.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3811src" href="#xd31e3811">100</a>
</p>
<p>1768. Harmer advanced a new theory. Whilst advocating with Grotius, Bossuet, Lowth,
Percy, &amp;c., that this Song in its literal and primary sense celebrates the nuptials
of Solomon with the daughter of Pharaoh, he maintained that the heroes of the plot
are not <i>two</i>, as generally believed, but <i>three</i>—viz., <i>Solomon</i>, the <i>Shulamite</i>, who is the principal wife and a Jewish queen, and <i>the daughter of Pharaoh</i>, whom Solomon afterwards married, with which the Jewish queen was exceedingly displeased,
and looked with jealousy upon the Gentile wife as an intruder. “This event of Solomon’s
marrying a <i>Gentile</i> princess, and making her <i>equal in honour and privilege</i> with his former Jewish queen, and of <i>her</i> being <i>frequently mentioned</i> afterwards in history, while the other is passed over in <i>total silence</i>, resembles <i>the conduct of the Messiah towards the Gentile and Jewish Churches</i>.” … “Nothing more, according to that,” says Harmer, “is to be sought for of the mystic
kind, than the making out the general resemblance between Solomon’s behaviour with
respect to his two queens, and the situation of affairs between the Messiah and the
two Churches; of those that observed the laws of Moses and those that did not.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3840src" href="#xd31e3840">101</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb86">[<a href="#pb86">86</a>]</span></p>
<p>The following analysis is gathered from Harmer’s singularly confused work. Chapter
I. describes Solomon and his attendants meeting the Egyptian bride and her companions;
ii. 1–iii. 5, describes the complaining language of the Jewish queen; iii. 6–v. 1,
resumes the account of Solomon’s journey with the Egyptian bride up to Jerusalem,
and describes the consummation of the marriage; v. 2–vi. 3, relates Solomon’s conversation
with his Jewish wife; vi. 4–9, Solomon’s conversation with the Egyptian wife in the
garden; vi. 10–viii. 7, begins with Solomon’s astonishment at his being surprised
by his Jewish wife whilst in the garden with the Egyptian wife, and the ensuing conversation
between them; viii. 8, describes the imaginative hope of the Jewish wife that Solomon’s
marriage with the Egyptian would not be consummated, and that she would, therefore,
not be treated as a wife; viii. 9, gives Solomon’s reply, that the Egyptian princess
should be treated with the highest honours; viii. 10–12, contains a smart reply of
the Egyptian princess to the Jewish queen, in which she at the same time also notices
the addition her marriage had made to the King’s possessions; viii. 13, states Solomon’s
appeal to the Jewish queen in the presence of all to give her final thoughts respecting
her future conduct; viii. 14, gives her resolution to keep her distance; but at the
same time there appears no thought of <i>renouncing her relation</i> to Solomon on her part, as “there was not on his.” “Such actually,” concludes Harmer,
“is the state of things with respect to the Messiah, and the two churches of Jews
and Gentiles. The Jewish Church persists in not receiving the Gentiles as fellow-heirs,
but they renounce not their relation to the Messiah, nor has he utterly excluded them
from hope. The state of distance has long continued, but as they still remain a <i>distinct body</i> of people, waiting for great events that are to happen, so the New Testament leads
us to expect their reconciliation.”
</p>
<p>1770. Different to these strange outlines of Harmer were the effects which Lowth’s
remarks upon this Song produced in <span class="pageNum" id="pb87">[<a href="#pb87">87</a>]</span>Germany. Michaelis, the celebrated professor at the Göttingen University, in his edition
of the Praelectiones, took a more advanced and decided step in the interpretation
of this book. He not only rejected the allegorical interpretation, as unsupported
by internal evidence, but denied the theory, defended by Lowth, &amp;c., that this poem
celebrates the nuptials of Solomon, because there is no direct mention made in any
part of this long poem of the marriage ceremony, nor of any circumstance attending
it; no time appearing appropriated to the nuptial banquet itself, the bride and the
bridegroom being separated from and in quest of each other, wishing and enjoying solitude,
always showing themselves in the street or field when conversing together, or with
the virgins, and never found with the guests or at the banquet; because it cannot
be possibly imagined that a bridegroom would be so necessitated to labour as not to
be able to devote the few days of his nuptial week to the celebration of his marriage;
that he would be compelled immediately to quit his spouse and his friends for whole
days in order to attend his cattle in the pastures; and especially because we could
not imagine that the bridegroom would at this time of the festival leave his bride,
to whom he professes to be so deeply attached, alone and unhappy, and not return at
night. The learned professor, therefore, concludes that this Song describes <i>the chaste passion of conjugal and domestic love; the attachment of two delicate persons
who have been long united in the sacred bond</i>; and then asks, <i>Can we suppose such happiness unworthy of being recommended as a pattern to mankind,
and of being celebrated as a subject of gratitude to the great Author of happiness?</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3857src" href="#xd31e3857">102</a>
</p>
<p>1771. The honour, however, of first elucidating the true design of this book is due
to J.&nbsp;T. Jacobi; notwithstanding the imperfections of his attempt. He showed that
the importance of this Song is not to describe the chaste passion of conjugal love,
but <i>to celebrate fidelity</i>. The pattern of this <span class="pageNum" id="pb88">[<a href="#pb88">88</a>]</span>conjugal fidelity is the Shulamite, the heroine of the book. This humble woman was
married to a shepherd. Solomon, being struck with her beauty, tempted her with the
luxuries and splendour of his court to forsake her husband and enter the royal harem;
but the Shulamite spurned all the allurements, and remained faithful to her humble
husband.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3866src" href="#xd31e3866">103</a> However strange the manner in which Jacobi divides this book, and the interpretation
of separate passages, it must be acknowledged that he was the first in Germany who
showed that Solomon was not the object of the Shulamite’s affections, and that the
beloved was a humble shepherd from whom the King endeavoured to separate her. It will
be remembered that Ibn Ezra, Immanuel, and the Anonymous Commentary,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3869src" href="#xd31e3869">104</a> have already taken the lovers to be <i>a shepherd</i> and <i>shepherdess</i>, and regarded Solomon as <i>a separate</i> person, whom the rustic maiden adduces in illustration of her sincere attachment
to her shepherd, affirming that if this great King were to bring her into his court,
and offer her all its grandeur and luxuries, she would still rejoice in her humble
lover.
</p>
<p>1772. It seems unaccountable that though the increased attention paid in this country
to the sound exegesis of the Scriptures compelled expositors to propound the literal
meaning of this book, that Durell<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3883src" href="#xd31e3883">105</a> could still overlook the <i>two distinct</i> persons referred to in this poem, viz. the King and the Shepherd, and maintain that
the Song of Songs is an epithalamium on Solomon’s marriage with Pharaoh’s daughter.
</p>
<p>1776. It was not to be expected that the opposition of sound critics, and much less
the newly propounded view of Jacobi, would at once subvert the old allegorical theories,
or check fertile imaginations from inventing new speculations. The Song of Songs was
too darling an object of those whose minds were addicted to allegories and mysticisms
to be so <span class="pageNum" id="pb89">[<a href="#pb89">89</a>]</span>easily surrendered to the simple meaning of the text. So far from being surprised,
we rather expect that every one who rejects the obvious sense of the Song will find
in it some new view which his predecessors had overlooked. And Herr von <span class="corr" id="xd31e3892" title="Source: Puffendorff’s">Puffendorf’s</span> new theory, therefore, only realises our expectations. He explained this Song hieroglyphically,
and by a process of reasoning as sound as that of the other allegorisers, found his
interpretation corroborated by analogy. The sacred picture language constituted the
wisdom of Solomon’s days, and was therefore used among all nations to express everything
divine. As Solomon was more versed in the Egyptian mysteries than any of his contemporaries,
he would necessarily write the divine mysteries contained in this book in hieroglyphics,
in accordance with the custom of those days. According to the deciphering of these
hieroglyphics by Puffendorf, “this much disputed Song treats almost exclusively of
the sepulchre of the Saviour, and his death, and the communion of believers, especially
of Old Testament saints; but it also describes their longing for his Advent, whereby,
however, the condition of the New Testament community, and even the resurrection from
the dead, are represented in prophetical types.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3895src" href="#xd31e3895">106</a> On the clause,
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“<i>The virgins love thee.</i>” Puffendorf remarks, “These are the pure and chaste souls which are locked up in
the dark sepulchre, and wait for the light;” and in a note says, “the root <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עָלַﬦ‎</span>, whence <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עֲלָמוֹת‎</span>, <i>virgins</i>, is derived, signifies <i>to be concealed</i>, as those souls were. The Egyptian Neitha, or Minerva, was the tutelar deity of pious
souls, and was covered with a veil, which none were allowed to uncover. The virgins,
concealed in the same manner, have to expect that through marriage they will emerge
into light. Thus the souls are here represented, which in the dominion of darkness
wait for salvation and light.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>The curious reader must consult the Commentary itself to see how this extraordinary
mode of exposition is carried through the book.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb90">[<a href="#pb90">90</a>]</span></p>
<p>1778. About two years after the publication of the deciphered hieroglyphics of this
Song, the allegorical interpretation sustained some most severe blows from the eminently
pious and celebrated poet Herder. He denounced the allegorisers as violating common
sense, and the established laws of language, and maintained that <i>this Song celebrated true and chaste love in its various stages</i>.
</p>
<p>Upon the question, whether there may not be <i>another sense</i> concealed under the obvious and literal meaning, Herder remarks—“When I read the
book itself I do not find the slightest intimation, or even the faintest trace that
such a sense was the design of the author. Were I to admit it, I should also expect
to find it in the Song of Ibrahim, in the odes of Hafiz, and in all the oriental erotic
poems which in form entirely resemble this Song. In the life of Solomon I discover
still less reason for this concealed sense, be it historical, mystical, metaphysical,
or political. For Solomon’s wisdom did not consist in mysticism, much less in metaphysics,
or scholastic church history. His wisdom was displayed in his common sense, as seen
in his view of the things of this life, in his acute penetration and extensive knowledge
of nature. Subsequent Arabian tradition has indeed attributed to him also the art
of sorcery, and of driving out evil spirits, but never did even this tradition ascribe
to him the downcast look of a mystic, or represent him as indulging in airy speculations,
or as writing a compendium of Christian Church History.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3934src" href="#xd31e3934">107</a>
</p>
<p>Herder admits that this book describes the love of <i>a shepherd</i> and shepherdess, as well as that of <i>a king</i>; but finding great difficulty to account for this, he divides the book into separate
songs, or amorets, while at the same time he acknowledges that there is a marked unity
throughout, and that love is <span class="pageNum" id="pb91">[<a href="#pb91">91</a>]</span>described from its first germs to its full maturity, its ripened fruit, and its first
regermination.
</p>
<p>1780. This beautiful commentary was followed by an elaborate work of Kleuker on this
Song.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3950src" href="#xd31e3950">108</a> He too, with an overwhelming force of argument, opposes the allegorical interpretation,
and maintains that the book consists of detached songs.
</p>
<p>1781. Ann Francis, a lady of much poetical taste, who, assisted by the learned Parkhurst,
published a poetical version of the Song,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3958src" href="#xd31e3958">109</a> was the first who adopted and defended the theory of Harmer, that this book speaks
of <i>two</i> wives, one a Jewish lady, who had been married to Solomon long before, and the daughter
of Pharaoh, whom the king had recently espoused.
</p>
<p>1786. Hodgson, however, was not influenced by the theory of Harmer, but, with Bossuet,
Lowth, Percy, &amp;c., regarded this poem as “an epithalamium written by Solomon, on his
marriage, as some have supposed, with the daughter of Pharaoh.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3965src" href="#xd31e3965">110</a>
</p>
<p>1789. The theory maintained by Abrabanel and Leon Hebraeus,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3973src" href="#xd31e3973">111</a> seems at this time to have found its way into the Christian Church. An unknown author,
mentioned by Magnus,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3978src" href="#xd31e3978">112</a> defended the view that <i>the bride of the Song represents wisdom, with whom Solomon converses</i>.
</p>
<p>1790. It is indeed cheering to meet again with some <span class="corr" id="xd31e3990" title="Source: glimpes">glimpses</span> of light amidst the dense darkness which gathered around this book. Ammon not only
vindicated its unity against some of his contemporaries, but showed that it <i>celebrates the victory of true and chaste love in humble life over the allurements
of courtly grandeur</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3995src" href="#xd31e3995">113</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb92">[<a href="#pb92">92</a>]</span></p>
<p>1801. In this country those who paid more regard to the established laws of language,
and were therefore constrained to admit a literal sense, mostly adhered to the opinion
that this poem is a nuptial song. Thus Williams maintained that it celebrates the
marriage of Solomon with Pharaoh’s daughter.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4001src" href="#xd31e4001">114</a>
</p>
<p>1803. Mason Good could not acquiesce in this opinion, because the matrimonial connexion
of the Hebrew monarch with the Egyptian princess was of an exclusively political character,
without any preceding personal intimacy or interchange of affection; whereas, the
connexion celebrated in this Song, “proceeded from reciprocal affection, from the
gentleness, modesty, and delicacy of mind, which are uniformly and perpetually attributed
to this beautiful and accomplished fair one.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4006src" href="#xd31e4006">115</a> He, therefore, regards this book as celebrating in distinct amorets, the reciprocal
attachment of Solomon and a female, who was a native of Sharon, which was a canton
of Palestine; conveying also a spiritual allegory.
</p>
<p>1813. Hug,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4011src" href="#xd31e4011">116</a> rejecting the literal interpretation, exercised, like the rest of the allegorisers,
the right of introducing a new theory. According to him, “the bride” means <i>the ten tribes</i>, and “the bridegroom” is <i>King Hezekiah</i>, and the book <i>describes allegorico-politically the longing of Israel after the destruction of Samaria
to be re-united with Judah, and the opposition of the citizens of Judah, represented
under the image of the brothers</i> (chap. viii. 8, 9) <i>to this re-union</i>.
</p>
<p>1820. The feeble arm raised by Jacobi, Ammon, &amp;c. in the defence of the true design
of this book against the mighty host of allegorisers, was greatly supported by the
learned Umbreit. In the introduction to his exposition of this Song, Umbreit maintains
that the design of the poem is <i>to celebrate the conquest of virtue in humble life over the allurements of royalty</i>. A <span class="pageNum" id="pb93">[<a href="#pb93">93</a>]</span>virtuous country-maiden, who was attached to a shepherd, was brought into Solomon’s
harem, and there tempted by the king with flatteries and promises to transfer her
affections; but she, armed by the power of virtue, resisted all his allurements, and
remained faithful to her shepherd, to whom she was afterwards re-united.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4032src" href="#xd31e4032">117</a>
</p>
<p>Though it cannot be said that either Clarke or Boothroyd in any way elucidated the
design of this book, yet they have done great service by their rejection of the allegorical
interpretation.
</p>
<p>1825. We must, however, not suppose that the allegorisers, though considerably diminished
in number, had exhausted their inventive faculties. Kaiser maintains that “the bride”
is <i>a new colony</i> near the Jordan, and the bridegroom represents <i>Zerubbabel</i>, <i>Ezra</i>, and <i>Nehemiah</i>; and that <i>the Song celebrates their restoration of the Jewish constitution in the province of
Judah</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4054src" href="#xd31e4054">118</a>
</p>
<p>1826. The little band, who struggled hard for the defence of the true design of this
book, could now rejoice at the accession of a mighty leader to their ranks. The celebrated
Ewald showed in a masterly manner that <span class="corr" id="xd31e4062" title="Not in source">“</span><i>this poem celebrates chaste, virtuous, and sincere love, which no splendour is able
to dazzle, nor flattery to seduce</i>.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4065src" href="#xd31e4065">119</a>
</p>
<p>1829. Döpke, in his elaborate philologico-critical commentary, though not espousing
this view, materially aided the combatants for the literal interpretation.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4070src" href="#xd31e4070">120</a>
</p>
<p>1830. It is surprising that the sharp-sighted Rosenmüller, who could not follow the
allegorical interpretation of the church, instead of adhering to the obvious sense
of the poem, <span class="pageNum" id="pb94">[<a href="#pb94">94</a>]</span>adopted the view of Abrabanel, Leon Hebraeus, &amp;c., that “the bride” represents <i>wisdom</i>, with whom Solomon is described as conversing.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4084src" href="#xd31e4084">121</a>
</p>
<p>Whilst the battle between the allegorisers and literalists was being waged on the
continent, the few champions who came forward in England to defend the literal interpretation
received an important addition to their number in the person of Dr. Pye Smith, who
denounced this method of treating Scripture as contrary to all laws of language, and
dangerous to real religion. He regards this Song as “a pastoral eclogue, or a succession
of eclogues, representing, in the vivid colour of Asiatic rural scenery, with a splendour
of artificial decoration, the honourable loves of a newly married bride and bridegroom,
with some other interlocutors.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4092src" href="#xd31e4092">122</a>
</p>
<p>1839. The controversy between Drs. Pye Smith and Bennett<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4097src" href="#xd31e4097">123</a> about the Song of Songs produced a salutary effect, inasmuch as it added considerably
to the number of those who in this country defended the literal interpretation. A
version of Chap. ii. 8–17 appeared in the Congregational Magazine,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4100src" href="#xd31e4100">124</a> in which the translator boldly affirms that “it celebrates the beautiful scenery
of the spring, the attachment of two individuals to each other, and their meeting
in that season of nature’s gaiety and loveliness.” He, moreover, declares that he
can “see no more reason for the spiritual interpretation which Mr. Williams, Mr. Fry,
and others give it, than for its application to the revival of letters, the termination
of feudalism, or any other gratifying circumstance in civil or political life.”
</p>
<p>1840. Whilst the ranks of the literalists grew stronger in England, the band that
defended the true design of this poem in Germany, also under the able leadership of
Ewald, became <span class="pageNum" id="pb95">[<a href="#pb95">95</a>]</span>stronger, and Hirzel now contended for the view that the Song of Songs <i>celebrates the victory of virtuous love in humble life over the allurements of royalty</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4109src" href="#xd31e4109">125</a>
</p>
<p>1842. The learned but “lynx-eyed” Magnus, however, could see in this book nothing
else than a collection of various erotic pieces, some perfect, others imperfect, some
amended, others interpolated, all the work of different authors, and written in various
ages.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4117src" href="#xd31e4117">126</a> Yet his commentary is full of learning, and well deserves to be mentioned in this
historical sketch.
</p>
<p>1845. Entirely different is the opinion of Professor Stuart, the great Biblical scholar
of America, who says, “It seems better and firmer ground, to regard the Canticles
as expressing the warm and earnest desire of the soul after God, in language borrowed
from that which characterises chaste affection between the Jews.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4122src" href="#xd31e4122">127</a>
</p>
<p>1846. It must not be supposed that all the American Professors were of the same opinion.
Dr. Noyes, Professor of Hebrew, &amp;c. in Harvard University, published a translation
of the Canticles with notes, shortly after the appearance of Stuart’s work, in which
he maintains that it is a collection of erotic songs, <i>without any moral or religious design</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4130src" href="#xd31e4130">128</a> and most powerfully opposes the allegorical interpretation.
</p>
<p>1847. Another Professor, Dr. Stowe, affirmed that “the general idea of the book, which
has just been pronounced ‘<i>as injurious to morals and religion</i>,’ if interpreted allegorically,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4137src" href="#xd31e4137">129</a> is descriptive of the mutual love of God and his people; the vicissitudes, the trials,
the backslidings, the repentings, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb96">[<a href="#pb96">96</a>]</span>finally the perfect and eternal union of the church with its Lord and Saviour.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4142src" href="#xd31e4142">130</a>
</p>
<p>1849. Though not entirely defeated, yet the ranks of the allegorisers were materially
thinned, and they were driven to adopt a different course. They no longer sought for
some <i>Christian</i> mysteries and doctrine in every chapter, verse, and word of the Song, but satisfied
themselves with a general allegorical idea, which may be seen both from the above
article of Dr. Stowe, and Keil’s “Introduction to the Song of Songs.” Dr. Keil submits
that it allegorically describes the mutual love subsisting between God and his chosen
people, and how this communion was in various ways interrupted through the unfaithfulness
of Israel, and how, through their return to the true covenant-God, and through his
unchanging love, it was again restored.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4149src" href="#xd31e4149">131</a>
</p>
<p>1851. Not even this mild view of the allegory, however, could conciliate Delitzsch.
This learned author, after having interpreted the book as representing “the mutual
love subsisting between Solomon and Wisdom,” was at last constrained to reject every
allegorical interpretation as untenable. Though adopting the view that <i>the book poetically describes a love-relationship formed by Solomon, and that “the
idea of marriage is the idea of the Song</i>,” and may figuratively represent <i>the union of God with his people</i>, he frankly confesses, that amongst other views, that which regards the poem as celebrating
the victory of virtuous love in humble life over the allurements of royalty, is to
be preferred.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4158src" href="#xd31e4158">132</a>
</p>
<p>1852. Immediately after the publication of this commentary, containing some of the
most cogent arguments against the allegorical interpretation, a new translation appeared
with an allegorical exposition by Hahn. Denying that Solomon represents <span class="pageNum" id="pb97">[<a href="#pb97">97</a>]</span>the Messiah, because at that early period the notion of <i>a personal</i> Messiah was not yet developed in the minds of the people, this commentator advances
a new theory, that “the bridegroom” represents <i>the kingdom of Israel</i>, and “the bride” <i>Japhetic heathenism</i>, and that the poem describes, allegorically, “<i>the kingdom of Israel as destined, in God’s service, eventually to overcome heathenism
with the weapons of justice and love, and to bring the Heathen into a state of fellowship
and love with itself, and consequently with God</i>.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4174src" href="#xd31e4174">133</a> He takes the Song to be a dramatico-didactic poem, divisible into six sections.
</p>
<p>The first section, Chap. i. 2–ii. 7, describes the longing of the maiden, who represents
Japhetic heathenism, for the pleasurable love of the king of Israel; her humble supplication
to be received into his fellowship, and the ultimate realization of her desire in
that union.
</p>
<p>The second section, Chap. ii. 8–iii. 5, supplementing the first, describes the friendly
invitation which the king of Israel gives to this maiden (the Japhetic heathen) to
catch with him the foxes, which represent the kingdom of Satan upon earth, the Hametic
heathen, and to unite herself with him in the land of Canaan, which is the kingdom
of God, and her acceptance of this invitation.
</p>
<p>The third section, Chap. iii. 6–v. 1, supplementing the first and second, represents
this maiden, after being conquered by the power of the king’s love, and from sincere
reciprocal attachment, devoting herself as an acceptable offering to the service of
God, as introduced into the land of Canaan, which is the type of the kingdom of God,
and describes the completion of her never-ending union with the king of Israel.
</p>
<p>The fourth section, Chap. v. 2–vi. 9, a supplementary explanation of the first, describes
the early love of the king of Israel when he visited the maiden in the dark night
as she lay in a deep sleep, void of all love to him, entreating to be admitted; <span class="pageNum" id="pb98">[<a href="#pb98">98</a>]</span>her refusal; her repentance after having become acquainted with his glory; her long
search after him; his accepting her after her repentance had been tried, &amp;c. &amp;c.
</p>
<p>The fifth section, Chap. vi. 10–viii. 4, which explains the second, and supplements
the fourth, describes how the king of Israel revealed himself ultimately to the maiden;
the king, after being long and painfully sought by the maiden, who, despairing of
success, and in a dejected state, had returned home, was again incited, by some new
charms of hers, followed her, attended by his martial hosts, once more offered her
his love, met with a hearty response, and then she offered herself to him with all
she had, as his property.
</p>
<p>The sixth section, Chap. viii. 5–14, which is a supplementary exposition of the third,
and a completion of the fifth, describes how the maiden, after long and painfully
searching, and longing for the king of Israel, yielded herself up to him in her home,
whither he had followed her, and how she entreated for the favourable reception of
her younger sister, that is, the Hametic heathen, and how the king promised the maiden
that her sister shall eventually be received.
</p>
<p>1853. Though this allegorist has repudiated the idea that Solomon represents the Messiah,
at the same time, another allegorist, and that a no less writer than Hengstenberg,
assures us that Solomon can be regarded only as <i>the Messiah</i>, and that the bride is not Japhetic heathenism, but <i>the people of God</i>. According to him, <i>the poem celebrates the Prince of Peace and all the mercies which through him flow
to the people of God</i>, and is divisible into two parts.
</p>
<p>The first part, Chap. i.–v. 1, describes the advent of Messiah, the heavenly Solomon,
to save his people; the tribulations and sorrows which will precede his coming, and
especially the bondage of the people of God to worldly power, as the merited punishment
of their unfaithfulness. These sufferings are represented under the figure of swarthiness,
i. 6; winter and rain, ii. 11; dark nights and a wilderness, iii. 6. Connected <span class="pageNum" id="pb99">[<a href="#pb99">99</a>]</span>with the coming of Messiah is the admission of the heathen into the kingdom of Christ,
iii. 9–11, effected through the mediation of the Old Testament people, as indicated
by the name “daughters of Jerusalem.”
</p>
<p>The second part, Chap. v. 2–viii. 14, describes the sinning of the daughter of Zion
against the heavenly Solomon, her punishment, repentance, and the re-union effected
through the mediation of the daughters of Jerusalem (the heathen), whose salvation
she had first assisted to accomplish; the complete restoration of the former mutual
love, in consequence of which the daughter of Zion becomes again the centre of the
kingdom of God; and the immutability of the new covenant of love in contrast with
the mutability of the old.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4201src" href="#xd31e4201">134</a>
</p>
<p>1853. Simultaneous with this commentary of Hengstenberg, an allegorical exposition
appeared in America, by Professor Burrowes. He differs again from the preceding in
regarding <i>this Song as illustrating by imagery drawn from the court of Solomon, the mutual love
of Christ and the Church, as exercised in the case of individual believers</i>. He divides it into three parts.
</p>
<p>The first part, Chap. i.–ii. 7, describes the way in which the soul, longing after
the manifestation of the love of Christ, is conducted in the gratification of that
desire, from one degree of pious enjoyment to another, till, by the vicissitudes of
fortune, and by the diversities in its progress towards heaven, and the enjoyment
of Christ’s love as manifested in private communion in “his chamber;” 7–11, in the
way of duty and self-denial; 12–14, in social communion with him; 15–17, in delightful
repose with him, amid enlarged prospects of spiritual beauty; chap. ii. 1–3, in the
protection and delight here set forth; 4–7, it possesses the greatest possible pleasure
on the earth.
</p>
<p>The second part, Chap. ii. 8–vii. 9, describes the motives by which the Lord Jesus
would allure such souls away from <span class="pageNum" id="pb100">[<a href="#pb100">100</a>]</span>the present world to be with him in glory; chap. ii. 8–17, as by the beauty of heaven;
chap. iii. 1–11, by the splendour of the reception awaiting them there, as well as
by the grandeur of the conveyance thither; chap. v. 1–vii. 9, and by his love for
them, which remains constant even amidst their greatest neglect.
</p>
<p>The third section, Chap. vii. 10–viii. 14, describes the effects which these manifestations
of love produce on the heart of saints; chap. vii. 10, assurance of hope; 11, desire
to be much alone in communion with Christ; 12, their engagement in labours of love;
13, consecration to him of all their gifts; chap. viii. 1, 2, a desire that everything
interposing between Christ and them may be removed; 3, 4, their avoidance of everything
that would cause the withdrawal of Christ’s love; 5, the pleasing consciousness of
leaning on Jesus, and of being upheld by his everlasting arm; 6, their desire to be
constantly near him, and sustained by his power, and willingness to make every sacrifice
for him; 7, their conviction of the insufficiency of everything the world could offer
to tempt them from Christ; 8–10, their interest for the salvation of the impenitent;
12, the sense of their accountability as stewards of God; 13, the privilege of continual
access to the throne of grace; 14, desire for the completion of their redemption,
and for the perfecting of their love to Christ, and of his to them, by the prospect
of his second coming.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4215src" href="#xd31e4215">135</a>
</p>
<p>From the analysis of the three latest commentaries upon this book, it will be perceived
that allegorical interpreters, even to this day, differ in their views of its application
and design.
</p>
<p>1854. After quitting the bewildering maze of allegorism, it is cheering to come to
the commentary of Meier, in which the view that this poem celebrates the victory of
virtuous love in humble life over the allurements of royalty is defended.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4221src" href="#xd31e4221">136</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb101">[<a href="#pb101">101</a>]</span></p>
<p>1855. This is also the view propounded by <span class="corr" id="xd31e4227" title="Source: Friederich">Friedrich</span><a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4229src" href="#xd31e4229">137</a> and Hitzig,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4235src" href="#xd31e4235">138</a> though the latter embraces a similar theory to Harmer, that there are <i>two</i> women as chief speakers in the poem.
</p>
<p>1856. In this opinion of the superiority of virtuous love to all the temptations of
royalty, the Jew and the Christian, the Englishman and the German, are beginning to
unite. The reviewer in the Jewish Monthly Journal of History and Science, declares
himself in favour of <i>regarding the Shulamite as resisting all the offers of Solomon and remaining faithful
to her shepherd</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4246src" href="#xd31e4246">139</a> Meier, the author of a commentary mentioned above, in his History of the poetical
National Literature of the Hebrews, recently published, maintains the same opinion.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4249src" href="#xd31e4249">140</a> This poem, says Dr. Davidson, “<i>warns against impure love, encourages chastity, fidelity, and virtue, by depicting
the successful issue of sincere affection amid powerful temptations. The innocent
and virtuous maiden, true to her shepherd lover, resists the flatteries of a monarch,
and is allowed to return to her home</i>.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4254src" href="#xd31e4254">141</a> Umbreit, in an article upon this book, just published, states that he still adheres
to the view propounded in his commentary of 1828,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4258src" href="#xd31e4258">142</a> noticed above, that it is a celebration of virtuous love over the allurements of
royalty.
</p>
<p>How mournful is the thought which irresistibly forces itself upon the mind, in reviewing
this imperfect sketch of what has befallen this poem! This book, we have seen, is
made to describe the most contradictory things. It contains the wanderings of the
Jews, how they will ultimately “fill their stomachs with the flesh of the Leviathan
and the best of wines preserved <span class="pageNum" id="pb102">[<a href="#pb102">102</a>]</span>in grapes,” and is the sanctum sanctorum of all Christian mysteries. It is denounced
as a love song, and extolled as declaring the incarnation of Christ; it speaks of
the meridian church in Africa, and of the betrayal of the Saviour; it contains a treatise
upon the doctrine of free grace against Pelagianism, and an Aristotelian disquisition
upon the functions of the active and passive mind; it is an apocalyptic vision, a
duplicate of the Revelations of St. John, and records the scholastic mysticisms of
the middle ages; it denounces Arianism, and describes the glories of the Virgin Mary;
it “treats of man’s reconciliation unto God and peace by Jesus Christ, with joy in
the Holy Ghost,” and teaches lewdness, and corrupts the morals; it records the conversation
of Solomon and Wisdom, and describes the tomb of Christ in Egyptian hieroglyphics;
it celebrates the nuptials of Solomon, and gives us a compendium of ecclesiastical
history to the second advent of Christ; it records the restoration of a Jewish constitution
by Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah, and the mysteries of marriage; it advocates monogamy
and encourages polygamy; it assists devotion and excites carnal passions. What a solemn
lesson we have here never to depart from the simple meaning of the word of God!

<h3 class="main">SECTION VI.—THE DIFFERENT VIEWS CLASSIFIED AND EXAMINED.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The various opinions, enumerated in the preceding section, respecting the design of
this book, may be divided into <i>three classes</i>, the <i>literal</i>, the <i>allegorical</i>, and the <i>typical</i>. The first considers the description as real, that the words should be taken as representing
an historical fact; the second considers that the description has no historical truth
for its basis, but contains some latent meaning; whilst the third admits the literal
meaning, but regards it as typical of spiritual truth. The literal view adopted by
us having been given in sections iii. and iv., we have to examine here only the claims
of the allegorical and typical.

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">THE ALLEGORICAL VIEW.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The allegorical view principally maintained is, <i>that this poem, in language borrowed from that which characterises chaste affections
between the sexes, expresses the mutual love subsisting between the Lord and his Church</i>.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 subsection">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">REASONS FOR THE ALLEGORICAL VIEW EXAMINED.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">1. The existence of this book in the sacred canon has been adduced as an argument
for its allegorical interpretation.
</p>
<p>“In what part of the Hebrew Bible can we find any composition of an analogous nature?
All—every Psalm, every piece of history, every part of prophecy—has a religious aspect,
and (the book of Esther perhaps excepted) is filled with theocratic views of things.
How came there here to be such a solitary exception, so contrary to the genius and
nature of the whole Bible? It is passing strange, if real amatory Idyls are mingled
with so much, all of which is of a serious and religious nature. If the author viewed
his composition as being of an amatory nature, would he have sought a place for it
among the <i>sacred</i> books? And subsequent redactors or editors—would they have ranked it here, in case
they had regarded it in the same light? I can scarcely deem it credible. So different
was the reverence of the Jews for their Scriptures from any mere approbation of an
amatory poem as such, that I must believe that the insertion of Canticles among the
<i>canonical</i> books, was the result of a full persuasion of its <i>spiritual</i> import. Had the case stood otherwise, why did they not introduce other secular books,
as well as this, into the canon?”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4297src" href="#xd31e4297">143</a>
</p>
<p>Granting that the design of the book was simply to describe <i>love</i>, we deny that it would have been deemed unworthy of a place in the sacred canon.
Why should the pleasures of chaste love be considered less worthy of record in the
sacred books, <span class="pageNum" id="pb104">[<a href="#pb104">104</a>]</span>than the sorrow for bereaved friendship, in 2 Sam. i. 17, &amp;c.? “To those,” says Dr.
Mason Good, a defender of the allegorical interpretation, “who disbelieve the existence
of such an allegory they (the amorets) still afford a happy example of the pleasures
of holy and virtuous love; they inculcate, beyond the power of didactic poetry, the
tenderness which the husband should manifest for his wife, and the deference, modesty,
and fidelity with which his affection should be returned; and, <i>considered even in this sense alone, they are fully entitled to the honour of constituting
a part of the sacred Scriptures</i>.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4308src" href="#xd31e4308">144</a> “Why should a passion,” remarks another allegorical interpreter, “so strong,<span id="xd31e4311"></span> so universal, so essential to happiness—to the very existence of the human race,
be denied a place in a Revelation from God to man? As a matter of fact, has it not
a place in every part of the Bible, from Genesis to Revelation? God is the author
of the human constitution as well as of the Bible; and he has in all respects adapted
his revelation to the nature of the beings for whom it was designed. It would be strange
indeed, if one of the most important and never absent phenomena in the moral and physical
creation of men should never be noticed in a revelation to him from his Creator. If
the viciousness and licentiousness of men have loaded this subject with vile and filthy
associations in vile and filthy minds, this is not the fault of God or of his revelation.
The vine will not be destroyed, nor the grapes annihilated, because wicked men make
themselves beasts with wine.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4314src" href="#xd31e4314">145</a>
</p>
<p>The design of the book, in our view, however, is not to celebrate love, but <i>to record an example of virtue</i>, which is still more worthy of a place in the sacred canon.
</p>
<p>2. It has been urged, that the language put by the sacred writer into the mouth of
the bride, shows that the poem is to be allegorically interpreted, because in its
literal sense such <span class="pageNum" id="pb105">[<a href="#pb105">105</a>]</span>language would be contrary to nature and to the modesty of women.
</p>
<p>“That this is <i>not</i> a song of human loves,” says Dr. Bennett,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4329src" href="#xd31e4329">146</a> “is clear from the beginning to the end. It opens with the language of a female:
‘Let him kiss me;’ it is full of her solicitous seeking after him; it abounds with
praises of his person, and her dispraises of herself, of her person and her conduct;
it invites other females to love him, and it speaks of him as her brother, and of
her as his sister. Let any one examine the Song, and then muse over these facts, recollecting
that Solomon is, in the opening of the poem itself, said to be the writer. Was ever
such a human love-song composed by mortal, since man either loved or wrote verses?
What writer, with the feelings, or the reason, of a man, would begin a poem on his
fair one by describing her as courting him? Let it not be said, ‘We must not transfer
our modern and northern ideas to the ancient Orientals, who had not our delicate notions
of the female character;’ for this would only make my case stronger. It would be more
abhorrent from the secluded, submissive character of Eastern brides to ask the gentlemen
to come and kiss them, than it would be from the dignified confidence of British women.
It is not a question of climate or age, but of <i>nature</i>. The bridegroom, who is supposed to love this fairest of women, himself puts into
her lips this speech: ‘Let him kiss me!’ Never would human love speak thus. Though
men like to court, they do not like to be courted; and while they think it cruel to
be rejected when they court, they without mercy reject her that courts them; as the
forward female has usually found, from the days of Sappho to this hour. Women were
endowed with the form and the qualities intended to attract courtship, and they feel
it; and when they do not feel it, men despise them. No man, therefore, in his senses,
would think to compliment his fair one by writing of her, to her, as if she had lost
her retiring modesty, her female dignity, and degraded <span class="pageNum" id="pb106">[<a href="#pb106">106</a>]</span>herself by doing that for which every man would despise her. The very first word of
this Song, then, stands a witness against the notion of its being a human love-song;
for it would better suit Solomon’s strange woman, that with an impudent face caught
and kissed the young simpleton, than Solomon’s princess-bride, or Dr. Smith’s supposed
chaste monogamist. Till fishes mount to sing with larks on the shady boughs, and nightingales
dive to ocean’s depths to court the whales, no man, of any age, of any clime, of any
rank, can be supposed to write ordinary love-songs in such a style. We are told, by
the first word, that a greater than Solomon is here, one who must be courted, and
that loves more than human are the theme. This is the Bridegroom of whom the Psalmist
says, ‘He is thy Lord, and worship thou him:’ ‘Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and
ye perish from the way.’ Such a spouse may exhibit his Bride as <i>asking</i> for his love; every other must present <i>himself</i> as asking for hers, and begging the acceptance of his.”
</p>
<p>It is allowed by scholars of taste, that, regarded as a mere human production, this
poem is inimitable. “Every part of this Song,” says the learned Bishop Bossuet,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4343src" href="#xd31e4343">147</a> “abounds in poetical beauties; the objects which present themselves on every side
are the choicest plants, the most beautiful flowers, the most delicious fruits, the
bloom and vigour of spring, the sweet verdure of the fields, flourishing and well-watered
gardens, pleasant streams, and perennial fountains. The other senses are represented
as regaled with the most precious odours, natural and artificial; with the sweet singing
of birds, and the soft voice of the turtle; with milk and honey, and the choicest
of wine. To these enchantments are added all that is beautiful and graceful in the
human form, the endearments, the caresses, the delicacy of love. If any object be
introduced which seems not to harmonize with this delightful scene, such as the awful
prospect of tremendous precipices, the wildness of the mountains, <span class="pageNum" id="pb107">[<a href="#pb107">107</a>]</span>or the haunts of lions, its effect is only to heighten, by the contrast, the beauty
of the other objects, and to add the charms of variety to those of grace and elegance.”
Bishop Lowth, after having descanted upon some passages, remarks, “Nothing can be
imagined more truly elegant and poetical than all these, nothing more apt or expressive
than these comparisons.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4348src" href="#xd31e4348">148</a> If the poet is so charming in his style, so exquisite and true in his picture of
nature, surely it is but reasonable to give him credit for understanding his art,
that he was acquainted with the manners and habits of the women of his age, and that
he would be as true to <i>nature</i> in the description of the bride as he is in depicting nature herself. If it be true
that language of such exquisite taste would outrage female decency and modesty when
addressed to <i>a human love</i>, it will surely be more outrageous when put into the mouth of the humble, penitent,
and submissive Church in addresses to <i>the Lord of lords</i>. Where in the Old or New Testament do we find any address from the saints to God
or Christ resembling the opening of this poem? The addresses of Abraham, (Gen. xviii.
23–33,) Jacob, (Gen. xxxii. 10–13,) and of Solomon himself, (1 Kings viii. 23–53,)
and the language in which Christ has taught us to appeal to God, are characterized
by the greatest reverence and humility. How, then, can it be affirmed, that language
which would violate female modesty and decency in the mouth of a woman to a lover
whom she prizes above all things, is becoming in the mouth of the Church when addressing
<i>the Holy One</i> of Israel?
</p>
<p>Dr. Bennett, however, misunderstood the design of the book. The Song, in its literal
meaning, does not <i>begin with representing a woman courting a man</i>, but describes how a humble and virtuous rustic maiden was taken away from her beloved
into the court of Solomon, and tempted to transfer her affections, by the splendour
and luxuries of royalty; but even there, amidst all the grandeur, and in spite of
all alluring promises, the <span class="pageNum" id="pb108">[<a href="#pb108">108</a>]</span>maiden was faithful to her espousals, and desired that he whom she prized above all
things would come and rescue her.
</p>
<p>3. It is urged that the same language and imagery employed in the Song, and the bridegroom
and the bride here introduced, are elsewhere spiritually applied to the Lord and his
people.
</p>
<p>“This sort of imagery,” says Professor Stuart, “is frequent in the Old Testament,
and in the New. Frequently are the Jews charged with ‘going a <i>whoring</i> after other gods,’ Exod. xxxiv. 15, 16; Lev. xx. 5, 6; Numb. xv. 39; Deut. xxxi.
16; 2 Chron. xxi. 13; Ps. lxxiii. 27; Ezek. vi. 9. Here the idea is, that they were
affianced to the true God, and could not seek after idols without incurring the guilt
of adultery. So God calls himself the <i>husband</i> of the Jews, Isa. liv. 5. The nation of Israel is his <i>bride</i>, Isa. lxii. 4, 5. In Isa. l. 1, Jehovah asks, ‘Where is the bill of divorcement’
on his part, that Israel has departed from Him? Jeremiah speaks of the espousals of
Israel, when young, in the wilderness.
</p>
<p>“In Jer. iii. 1–11, the prophet speaks of Israel as playing the harlot, and committing
adultery, in forsaking Jehovah. In Ezekiel, two long chapters (xvi., xxiii.) are occupied
with carrying through the imagery drawn from such a connexion. Hosea (i.–iii.) recognises
the same principle, and carries out the imagery into much detail. These are merely
specimens. Ps. xlv. presents the Mediator, the King of Zion, in the attitude of a
husband to the Church, and celebrates the union between the former and the latter.
So in the New Testament this imagery is very familiar: see Matt. ix. 25; John iii.
29; Rev. xix. 7; xxi. 2. Especially consult 2 Cor. xi. 2, and Eph. v. 22–32, where
the Apostle has gone into much particularity as to the duties of the marriage relation,
and then avows that he ‘speaks concerning Christ and the Church.’
</p>
<p>“Such is the custom of the Hebrew writers and of the Apostles. If, now, this imagery
is so often employed in all parts of the Bible, what forbids the idea, that there
may be one short book in which it occupies an exclusive place, and is designed to
<span class="pageNum" id="pb109">[<a href="#pb109">109</a>]</span>symbolize the love that existed between God and his ancient people, or the Church;
or rather, which ought to have existed on their part between God and his spiritually
regenerated people, who have become one (in a spiritual sense) with him, and are for
ever united to him? It cannot be shown, <i>à priori</i>, that it is even improbable.”
</p>
<p>First. What does this argument prove? Surely not what the representation of this poem
<span class="asc">IS</span>; it only shows what <i>it might have been</i>. It shows that if we had <i>indubitable proof, as in the passages cited</i>, that a whole book in the sacred canon is entirely devoted to symbolize, under the
figure of <i>husband</i> and <i>wife</i>, the covenant-relationship subsisting between <i>God</i> and <i>his people</i>, we ought not to be surprised at it, since it would be in harmony with those alleged
passages. But surely it does not follow, that, because we are distinctly told in some
passages of Scripture that the terms, husband and wife, are employed to symbolize
the relationship between God and his people, that they should have this signification
as often as they are employed.
</p>
<p>Second. We utterly deny that the covenant-relation which subsisted between the Lord
and Israel was represented by the terms, <i>husband</i> and <i>wife</i>, <i>before</i> the days of Solomon. The phrase, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏זנה אחרי אלהים אחרים‎</span>, <i>to go whoring after other gods</i>, to which reference has been made, does not mean that Israel, by worshipping idols,
committed <i>spiritual adultery</i> against the true God to whom they were affianced,—thus presupposing God to be their
<i>husband</i>, and Israel his <i>wife</i>,—but describes <i>a literal fact</i>, the libidinous orgies and prostitutions identified with heathen worship which the
Jews indulged in when worshipping idols. Numb. xxv. 1; Hos. iv. 13, &amp;c. This is evident
from Exod. xxxiv. 15, 17, where this phrase first occurs, and is applied to <i>heathen women</i> worshipping their <i>own</i> gods. And though these women stood in no such covenant-relation to the God of Israel,
and therefore could not incur the guilt of <i>spiritual adultery</i>, yet they are described as “<i>whoring after</i> <span class="asc">THEIR</span> <i>gods</i>.” <span class="pageNum" id="pb110">[<a href="#pb110">110</a>]</span>From these licentious rites, therefore, originated this phrase, afterwards used to
describe the worship of idols. But even admitting that it does suggest a marriage
relationship between God and his people, the distance between a <i>suggestive phrase</i> of this kind and an <i>entire book</i> of marital descriptions is so great, that the one cannot be reasonably supposed to
have suggested the other.
</p>
<p>Third. We deny that even the language used by the prophets <i>after</i> the days of Solomon, in the passages cited, is at all analogous to that of this poem.
Let us examine some of the passages themselves. Isa. l. 1:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Where is the bill of your mother’s divorce </p>
<p class="line">With which I dismissed her?” </p>
</div>
<p class="first">Isa. liv. 4–6:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Fear not, for thou shalt not be ashamed, </p>
<p class="line">And be not abashed, for thou shalt not blush; </p>
<p class="line">For thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, </p>
<p class="line">And the reproach of thy widowhood thou shalt remember no more. </p>
<p class="line">For he weddeth thee who made thee. </p>
<p class="line">Jehovah of hosts is his name, </p>
<p class="line">And the Holy One of Israel redeemeth thee. </p>
<p class="line">He is called the God of the whole earth. </p>
<p class="line">For Jehovah calleth thee, as a forsaken wife, when spirit-broken, </p>
<p class="line">And as a wife of youth when melting in repentance, saith thy Lord.” </p>
</div>
<p class="first">Isa. lxii. 4, 5:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“No more shall it be said to thee, Thou forsaken! </p>
<p class="line">And no more shall it be said to thy land, Thou desolate! </p>
<p class="line">But thou shalt be called, The object of my delight, </p>
<p class="line">And thy land, The married woman; </p>
<p class="line">For Jehovah delighteth in thee, </p>
<p class="line">And thy land shall be married; </p>
<p class="line">For the young man shall marry the virgin; </p>
<p class="line">Thy children shall marry thee; </p>
<p class="line">And with the joy of a bridegroom over his bride </p>
<p class="line">Shall thy God rejoice over thee.” </p>
</div>
<p class="first">Jer. iii. 20:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“As a wife faithlessly departeth from her husband, </p>
<p class="line">So have ye acted faithlessly towards me, </p>
<p class="line">O house of Israel! saith Jehovah.” </p>
</div>
<p class="first">These, and several more of a similar kind, are the passages referred to, to prove
that the bridegroom and bride in this Song mean the Lord and his people! How totally
different <span class="pageNum" id="pb111">[<a href="#pb111">111</a>]</span>is the strain of thought and expression in those passages to that in the Song!
</p>
<p>In the former, the <i>wedded-relation</i> forms the comparison; in the latter, <i>ante-nuptial</i> love is the theme. In the former, the <i>general</i> idea of the figure is briefly used, without any particulars of the accompaniments;
in the latter, particulars of the persons, dresses, scenery, are largely described.
In the former, God is represented as the High and Holy One inhabiting eternity, and,
in his infinite condescension and compassion, loving, with the tenderness of a husband,
Israel, who is represented as an unlovely, ungrateful, and unfaithful wife; in the
latter, the bridegroom and the bride are placed upon <i>an equality</i>, nay, the bridegroom declares that his heart has been ravished by the charms and
faithfulness of the bride. In the former we are <i>distinctly told</i> that the husband means the Lord, and the wife the people of Israel, so that the most
superficial reader is compelled to perceive it; in the latter we have <i>no intimation whatever</i> that the lovers are intended to represent God and his people, and no reader would
ever gather it from the poem. This will appear all the more forcible when we remember
that, supposing this poem to be a description of the covenant-relation subsisting
between God and his people, it contains the completest representation of this kind.
We should, therefore, naturally expect that subsequent writers, employing the same
figure, would borrow something of the imagery and colouring from it. But, so far from
this being the case, there is not the slightest analogy between the strain of thought
and expression of this poem and that of subsequent writers.
</p>
<p>Fourth. The 45th Psalm, which is <i>supposed</i> to celebrate, allegorically, the union of the Messiah and the Church, has been adduced
as analogous to the Song of Songs, and therefore an evidence in behalf of the allegorical
interpretation.
</p>
<p>“If we admit,” says Hengstenberg, “the allegorical interpretation of this Psalm, we
shall also be obliged to drop the literal meaning of the Song of Songs.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb112">[<a href="#pb112">112</a>]</span></p>
<p>Is it certain, however, that this Psalm is all allegory? The Psalm itself gives not
the slightest intimation that it is to be understood in any other than its literal
sense. Let us examine it:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">“My heart boils with good matter; </p>
<p class="line">When I think my work is for the king, </p>
<p class="line">My tongue becomes as a style of a quick writer. </p>
<p class="line">Thou art beautiful, beautiful above the sons of men: </p>
<p class="line">Charm is poured upon thy lips, </p>
<p class="line">Therefore God has blessed thee for ever. </p>
<p class="line">Gird thy sword on thy thigh, O hero! </p>
<p class="line">Thy splendour and thy glory, yea, thy glory, </p>
<p class="line">Ride on victoriously for truth and mildness and right. </p>
<p class="line">Great things shall thy right hand teach thee! </p>
<p class="line">Thy arrows are sharp—people fall under thee— </p>
<p class="line">They dart into the heart of the king’s enemies! </p>
<p class="line">Thy throne, O God, stands for ever and ever; </p>
<p class="line">A sceptre of justice is the sceptre of thy kingdom; </p>
<p class="line">Thou lovest right, and hatest wrong; </p>
<p class="line">Therefore God, thy God, anointed thee </p>
<p class="line">With gladdening oil above thy companions! </p>
<p class="line">Myrrh, aloes, and cassia are all thy garments, </p>
<p class="line">Out of ivory palaces stringed instruments joyfully greet thee; </p>
<p class="line">Kings’ daughters are among thy dear ones— </p>
<p class="line">Upon thy right hand stands the queen in gold of Ophir. </p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Hear, O daughter, and see, and incline thine ear; </p>
<p class="line">Forget thy people and thy father’s house, </p>
<p class="line">That the king may desire thy beauty, </p>
<p class="line">For he is thy Lord, and honour thou him. </p>
<p class="line">O daughter of Tyre, now with presents </p>
<p class="line">The rich of the people salute thy face. </p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">The king’s daughter stands in the palace in all the splendour, </p>
<p class="line">Her clothing is of fabricated gold, </p>
<p class="line">She is led to the king in wrought raiment; </p>
<p class="line">Behind her are the virgins, her companions, brought for thee; </p>
<p class="line">They are conducted with joy and rejoicing, </p>
<p class="line">They enter the palace of the king. </p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Instead of thy fathers shall be thy sons; </p>
<p class="line">Thou wilt set them as princes over the whole land. </p>
<p class="line">I wilt celebrate thy name from generation to generation; </p>
<p class="line">Therefore shall nations praise thee for ever and ever.” </p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">This Psalm is evidently a congratulatory nuptial-song, composed for the occasion of
a king’s marriage with a princess of Tyre. The sacred writer begins by stating that
such is the greatness of the subject, that it awakens thoughts too big for <span class="pageNum" id="pb113">[<a href="#pb113">113</a>]</span>utterance; but recollecting that his work is for the king, at once his tongue is loosed,
and glides as rapidly as the stylus of a quick writer (2). He then celebrates the
king’s beauty and eloquence, recognising in it God’s blessing (3), his valour, symbolized
by the conquering sword, the prosperous chariot, the terrible arm, the well-directed
arrow (4–6), his divine throne, and love of justice (7), his great happiness, resulting
from his love for justice (8), which consists in the splendour around him (9), in
his magnificent harem, and especially in the new princess-bride at his right hand
(10). Having gradually arrived at the subject which is the occasion of the poem, the
sacred writer now addresses the bride, and, in accordance with Eastern custom, which
represents brides as unwilling to leave their parents on the day of espousals (Comp.
Deut. xxi. 13), telling her to forget her father’s house, as she will have such glory
as is just described (11, 12). The bride is then presented with gifts, according to
Oriental manners, from the first ladies of the kingdom (13); she appears in all the
splendour in the first palace (14), and thence conducted in grand procession to the
king’s palace (15, 16). The marital procession now being over, the inspired writer
congratulates the king, wishing him a happy issue (17), and concludes by saying that
his renown will rapidly spread (18).
</p>
<p>What is there in this Psalm compelling us to understand it allegorically? The quotation
of the sixth verse in Hebrews i. 8, 9, only proves that <i>this verse</i> refers in a higher sense to the Messiah, but not that the <i>whole</i> Psalm is descriptive of him. Who would think of allegorizing the eighth chapter of
Isaiah, because verses 17 and 18 are quoted in Hebrews ii. 13? The throne of David
is declared to be an <i>everlasting</i> throne, 2 Sam. vii. 13, 16; a <i>throne of God</i>, i.e. a divine throne, since the Messiah was to be the last and <i>ever reigning</i> king. Hence it is said, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏וַיֵּשֶׁב שְׁלֹמֹה עַל כִּסֵּא יְהֹוָה <span class="corr" id="xd31e4570" title="Source: לְמֶלָכְ">לְמֶלֶכְ</span> תַּחַת דָּוִיד אָבִיו‎</span>, “and Solomon sat upon the <i>throne of Jehovah</i> as king instead of his father David.”—1 Chron. xxix. 23. Every king, therefore, <span class="pageNum" id="pb114">[<a href="#pb114">114</a>]</span>of that lineage, occupying the throne, was regarded as the representative of God;
as the predecessor and type of Him who was to be born of the seed of David to occupy
the throne in the highest sense. So that, whether we translate <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כִּסְּאֲךָ אֱלֹהִים‎</span> <i>thy throne, O God</i>, taking <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֱלֹהִים‎</span> as <i>a vocative</i>, or <i>thy God-throne</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the throne committed to thee by God, or, <i>thou art seated upon a throne of God</i>, or regard the phrase as an <i>ellipsis</i> for <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כִּסְּאֲךָ כִּסֵּי אֱלֹהִים‎</span>, <i>thy throne is a throne of God</i>, comes substantially to the same thing. It is, therefore, a groundless assertion,
that the whole Psalm is an allegory, and the reference to it in proof of the allegorical
interpretation of the poem before us is nugatory.
</p>
<p>But, even admitting that the 45th Psalm is an allegory, this would by no means prove
that the Song of Songs is also an allegory, for the two cases differ essentially.
In the former the bridegroom is addressed in verse 8 as <i>God</i>, and this verse is quoted in the New Testament, whereas in the latter there is nothing
of the kind.
</p>
<p>4. The custom of oriental nations to express their religious and devotional sentiments
under the disguise of amatory and drinking songs has been adduced as an argument in
favour of the allegorical interpretation of the Song of Songs.
</p>
<p>“The durweesh,”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4612src" href="#xd31e4612">149</a> says Lane, “pointed out the following poem as one of those most common at Zikrs,
and as one which was sung at the Zikr which I have begun to describe. I translated
it verse for verse, and imitate the measure and system of the original, with this
difference only, that the first, third, and fifth lines of each stanza rhyme with
each other in the original, but not in my translation.

<p class="first">“I must translate a few more lines, to show more strongly the similarity of these
songs to that of Solomon; and lest it should be thought that I have varied the expressions,
I shall not attempt to translate into verse. In the same collection of poems sung
at Zikrs is one which begins with these lines:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">‘O gazelle from among the gazelles of El-Yem’en! </p>
<p class="line">I am thy slave without cost; </p>
<p class="line">O thou small of age, and fresh of skin! </p>
<p class="line">O thou who art scarce past the time of drinking milk!’ </p>
</div>
<p class="first">“In the first of these verses we have a comparison exactly agreeing with that in the
concluding verse of Solomon’s Song; for the word which, in our Bible, is translated
a ‘roe,’ is used in Arabic as synonymous with <i>ghaza’l</i> (or a gazelle); <span class="pageNum" id="pb116">[<a href="#pb116">116</a>]</span>and the mountains of El-Yem’en are ‘the mountains of spices.’ This poem ends with
the following lines:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">‘The phantom of thy form visited me in my slumber. </p>
<p class="line">I said, “O phantom of slumber! who sent thee?” </p>
<p class="line">He said, “He sent me whom thou knowest; </p>
<p class="line">He whose love occupies thee!” </p>
<p class="line">The beloved of my heart visited me in the darkness of night; </p>
<p class="line">I stood, to show him honour, until he sat down. </p>
<p class="line">I said, “O thou my petition, and all my desire, </p>
<p class="line">Hast thou come at midnight, and not feared the watchmen?” </p>
<p class="line">He said to me, “I feared, but, however, love </p>
<p class="line">Had taken from me my soul and my breath.<span class="corr" id="xd31e4703" title="Source: ’”">” ’</span> </p>
</div>
<p class="first">“Compare the above with the second and five following verses of the fifth chapter
of Solomon’s Song. Finding that songs of this description are extremely numerous,
and almost the only poems sung at Zikrs; that they are composed for this purpose,
and intended only to have a spiritual sense (though certainly not understood in such
a sense by the generality of the vulgar); I cannot entertain any doubt as to the design
of Solomon’s Song.”
</p>
<p>To this we cannot do better than quote the able reply of Dr. Noyes:—“Now, as to the
first of these religious love-songs of the Mahometan dervishes, whatever slight resemblance
it may have to any part of the Canticles, it differs essentially from any of them
in the circumstance, that the Supreme Being is expressly introduced as the object
of worship. Without this essential circumstance, no one could tell whether it were
originally composed for a love-song, or a religious hymn expressing a longing for
a union of the soul with God, according to the Sufi philosophy and religion.
</p>
<p>“In the second poem, quoted by Mr. Lane, it is to be regretted that he did not quote
the whole of it; for I can by no means admit the circumstance, that it was sung by
the dervishes in their morning devotions, to be conclusive in regard to the original
design of the hymn. Mr. Lane expressly tells us, in a note, that he found the last
six lines inserted, with some slight alterations, as a common love-song, in a portion
of the ‘Thousand and One Nights,’ printed at Calcutta, vol. i. <span class="pageNum" id="pb117">[<a href="#pb117">117</a>]</span>p. 225; Lane’s translation, ii. p. 349. Whether the whole was originally composed
as a love-song or a devotional hymn, does not appear from the parts of it which Mr.
Lane gives us. If in the parts omitted there is any clear reference to the Deity,
it is unlike any of the Canticles. If there is no such reference, the meaning of the
hymn is too doubtful to allow any inference to be drawn from it. For we might as well
allow the singing of Dr. Watts’s version of the Canticles to be an argument for their
original design, as to admit the singing of the mystic dervishes to be an evidence
of the original design of the hymns.
</p>
<p>“Before making some general remarks on this whole subject of attempting to show the
character of the Canticles by reference to the pantheistic poetry of the Mahometan
Sufis, it may be well to mention that reference has been made even to the poets of
Hindostan for the same purpose; especially to the Gitagovinda, the production of a
celebrated Hindoo poet, named Jayadeva. This appears to be a mystical poem, designed
to celebrate the loves of Crishna and Radha, or the reciprocal attraction between
the divine goodness and the human soul. Now, whatever may be the resemblance between
the Gitagovinda and Canticles in some of their imagery, there is this essential difference,
that, in the former, Crishna was the chief incarnate god of the Hindoos,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4714src" href="#xd31e4714">152</a> and that there are references to other gods, and to various superstitions of the
Hindoo mythology; whilst in the Canticles there is no reference to any but human characters.
Besides, the author of the Gitagovinda clearly intimates its religious character in
the conclusion of the poem.
</p>
<p>“We have seen, then, that there are material differences between the Canticles and
the religious love-songs to which <span class="pageNum" id="pb118">[<a href="#pb118">118</a>]</span>reference has been made. But supposing the resemblance to be much greater than it
is, those mystical songs do not in any essential respect resemble the Canticles more
than they do the odes of Anacreon, or some of the eclogues of Virgil, and the idyls
of Theocritus. And it is not easy to see why the resemblance does not prove the religious
character of the odes of Anacreon as much as that of the Canticles.
</p>
<p>“But, after all, the great objection remains to any conclusion drawn from the pantheistic
mystic poets, whether of Persia or India, whether Mahometans or Hindoos, namely, that
their productions are founded on a religion and philosophy entirely different from
the Jewish. The Canticles are productions of a different country, and separated from
any of the songs of the Sufi poets by an interval of nearly two thousand years. The
Jewish religion has nothing in common with the pantheistic mysticism on which those
songs are founded. There is nothing in the Old Testament of a similar character. If
any production similar to those mystical love-songs had existed in the religious literature
of the Hebrews, undoubtedly we should have found some in the Book of Psalms, which
comprises compositions from the age preceding that of David to a period long after
the return of the Jews from the captivity at Babylon. But in the most fervent Psalms,
the forty-second, for instance, nothing of the kind is found. Neither is anything
similar to those mystic songs ascribed to the Jewish sect, as described by Josephus
and Philo. Nothing of the kind is laid to the charge of the Essenes. It is needless
to say, that nothing approaching to the like character is found in the New Testament.
Nothing similar is discovered even in the allegorical paraphrase of the Targumist
on the Canticles. All those religious love-songs are founded on the Sufi religion,
or rather religious philosophy, which, whether it was borrowed from India, as Von
Hammer supposes, or arose independently among the Mahometans, according to the opinion
of Tholuck, has no connexion with, or resemblance to, the Jewish. It is as different
<span class="pageNum" id="pb119">[<a href="#pb119">119</a>]</span>from the latter as darkness from light. The argument, therefore, which is drawn from
the mystical songs of the Mahometan devotees for ascribing a mystical character to
the Canticles, is without foundation.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4734src" href="#xd31e4734">153</a>

<div class="div3 subsection">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">REASONS AGAINST THE ALLEGORICAL INTERPRETATION.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">1. In every allegory, or parable, employed in the Scripture, or in any good human
composition, something is wrought into its texture to indicate most unmistakably its
allegorical design; that, under the garb of an immediate representation, is conveyed
one more remote. Thus, in the 80th Psalm, 9–17, where Israel is represented under
the allegory of a vine which came out of Egypt, the design is distinctly wrought into
the texture of the allegory. The expression, <i>heathen</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גוֹיִם‎</span>), at the very beginning of the allegory, and especially the words, “<i>the Son</i> whom thou hast chosen for thyself,” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עַל בֵּן אִמַּצְתָּה לָךְ‎</span>) in the second clause of verse 15, which, when compared with “<i>the Son of man</i>, whom thou hast chosen for thyself,” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עַל בֵּן אָדָם אִמַּצְתָ לָךְ‎</span>) in verse 17, are evidently explanatory of the words, “and protect what thy right
hand hath planted,” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏וְכַנָּה אֲשֶׁר נָטְעָה יְמִינֶיךָ‎</span>) in the first clause, clearly to show the more remote concealed under the immediate
representation. Thus, also, in the allegory of the vineyard, and by the prophet Isaiah
(chap. v.), we are distinctly told, in verse 7, that “the vineyard of Jehovah of hosts
is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah are his pleasant plantation.” Compare
also Judges ix. 7–20; 2 Kings xiv. 9, 10; Ezek. xvi., xxxvii. 1–14; the parables of
our Saviour, Acts x. 10–17; Gal. iv. 22–31. Now, if the author of this poem had intended
it to be understood allegorically, he would have given some indication to that effect;
especially since the allegories occasionally used in some parts of this very book,
chap. iv. 12, v. 1, vii. 7, 8, are rendered plain and obvious. As there is, however,
not the slightest <span class="pageNum" id="pb120">[<a href="#pb120">120</a>]</span>intimation in the whole of this lengthy poem that it is designed to be allegorical,
we are unwarranted to assume it. To take one portion of the Scriptures allegorically,
without even an obscure hint of it in the writing itself, is to violate the established
laws of language, and to expose all other portions of the sacred volume to a similar
treatment. If one chooses to allegorize one part without any sanction, another may
choose to allegorize another. But we have no right to depart from the literal and
obvious meaning, without some authority for it from the inspired writer. This argument
is applicable to every allegorical interpretation, whether historical or hieroglyphical,
whether political or metaphysical.
</p>
<p>2. The total silence of our Lord and his apostles respecting this book is against
its allegorical interpretation. If this Song, according to the first and last <span class="corr" id="xd31e4764" title="Source: allegorizers">allegorisers</span>, “celebrates the glories of the Messiah, and all the mercies which through him flow
to the people of God,” it is more spiritual and more evangelical than any other portion
of the Old Testament; surpassing even the writings of Isaiah, who is called the fifth
Evangelist, and is, in fact, what Origen called it, “The Holy of Holies.” Is it possible,
then, that our Saviour, and his apostles, who, in their disputations with the Jews,
so frequently quoted the prophecies of Isaiah and other passages of the Old Testament,
far less evangelical and Messianic, would never have referred to this book? Is it
possible that the apostle Paul, who so frequently describes the relation of Christ
to the Church by the union subsisting between husband and wife (2 Cor. xi. 2, Rom.
vii. 4, Eph. v. 23–32), would be silent about a book which, more than any other in
the Old Testament, sets forth that union? The fact, therefore, that our Saviour and
his apostles never once refer to this book is against the allegorical interpretation.
</p>
<p>3. Is Solomon the man from whom a production of such preeminent spirituality and evangelical
truth could have been reasonably expected? Is there anything in his private history,
<span class="pageNum" id="pb121">[<a href="#pb121">121</a>]</span>his habits of thought, his moral inclinations, or in the general tone and tendency
of his religious emotions, at any period of his life, as far as they can be gathered
from his history and writings, that would lead us to anticipate such evangelical piety
as this interpretation presupposes? The same agreement which exists between ordinary
writers and their productions is perceptible in the inspired records. Inspiration,
like Providence, selected the fittest instruments for its work. Thus, between the
history of Moses and his writings, of David and his writings, of Paul and his writings,
of John and his writings, a natural uniformity exists; and so of other sacred authors.
Accordingly, we have not only to suppose Solomon to have been more spiritually-minded
than any under the Jewish economy, but to have stood upon a level with the most enlightened
and Christ-loving under the present dispensation, in order to write in such a strain.
Where is any such qualification in Solomon, even remotely intimated in any part of
Scripture? The wisdom which he asked, which he received, and for which he gained celebrity,
was that displayed in his civil government, in social and moral teaching, of which
the first-fruit was given in the decision upon the litigation of the two mothers.
The poetry which he wrote, consisting of one thousand and five songs, upon natural
history, not having been deemed worthy of a place in the sacred canon, shows that
his muse did not indulge in a devotional strain. The Book of Ecclesiastes, which is
attributed to him by tradition, is the experience of a thorough-going worldling and
libertine, and a confession to men rather than God. The extensive harem which he had,
displays his inordinate desire for revels and foreign women, which in old age inveigled
him into the practice of idolatry. “His wives,” as the Scriptures teach us, “turned
away his heart after other gods.” And the last we hear of him is, that “his heart
was not perfect with the Lord his God, as was the heart of his father David.” Is this,
then, the man whose love-song is to be regarded as pre-eminently <span class="pageNum" id="pb122">[<a href="#pb122">122</a>]</span>spiritual, and to be exalted as more evangelically rapturous than any other portion
of Holy Writ? To what period of his life is this pre-eminent piety to be assigned?
If to the latter, that is the period of his greatest degeneracy; if to the former,
how are we to reconcile his apostasy with so high a degree of spirituality? It is
difficult to conceive of such a mind as that of Solomon brought at any time into sympathy
with the prevailing allegorical exposition of this Song. Who can conceive that he
who caused an irreparable breach in his kingdom should represent <i>himself</i> as the Prince of Peace, or that he who was the embodiment of the carnal propensities
should describe, under the figure of <i>chaste love</i>, the union of Christ and his Church? It is inconceivable. As David was not qualified
to build the temple, because he had been a man of war, and had shed blood, so Solomon
was not qualified to write in such a spiritual strain concerning Christ and his Church
as the prevailing allegorical exposition of this Song, because he had been a man of
lust, and had turned aside to idolatry.
</p>
<p>4. For the same reason we cannot conceive that any other writer would represent the
Messiah as symbolized by Solomon. Is it conceivable that he of whom the whole congregation
of Israel complained to Rehoboam, “Thy father made our yoke grievous—now, therefore,
make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon
us, light,” would be chosen to represent the Saviour of the world, “whose yoke is
easy, and his burden light?” We can understand why the painter of the Judgment Scene,
among the celebrated frescoes in the cloisters of the Campo Santo at Pisa, in Italy,
in which the righteous and the wicked are gathered in their respective positions,
placed Solomon midway between them, as an intimation of his inability to determine
to which he belonged; but we cannot understand how an inspired writer could choose
Solomon, whose lusts were displayed in the revels of an Eastern harem, and who was
seduced to practise idolatry, to represent Him who was “holy, harmless, undefiled,
and <span class="pageNum" id="pb123">[<a href="#pb123">123</a>]</span>separate from sinners,” together with the pure and holy union subsisting between him
and the Church.
</p>
<p>5. In the allegorical interpretation language is attributed to Christ inconsistent
with his dignity and purity. It is almost blasphemous to suppose Christ thus to address
his Church:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“The circuits of thy thighs are like ornaments, </p>
<p class="line">The work of a master’s hand. </p>
<p class="line">Thy navel is a round goblet, </p>
<p class="line">Let not spiced wine be wanted in it! </p>
<p class="line">Thy growth is like a palm tree, </p>
<p class="line">And thy bosom like its clusters: </p>
<p class="line">I long to climb this palm tree, </p>
<p class="line">I long to clasp its branches. </p>
<p class="line">May thy bosom be unto me </p>
<p class="line">As the cluster of the vine, </p>
<p class="line">And the odour of thy breath </p>
<p class="line">As that of apples.”—Chap. vii. verses 2, 3, 7, 8. </p>
</div>
<p class="first">This is the language of seduction, but it is blasphemous when put into the mouth of
Him who spake as never man spake.
</p>
<p>6. The fact that <i>three</i> individuals are the principal persons represented in this Song, and not <i>two</i>, is subversive of the allegorical theory. That the poem speaks of three individuals,
a shepherd, a shepherdess, and a king, and that the shepherd, and not the king, is
the object of the maiden’s affections, will be evident to every unbiassed reader of
the book, and has been recognised by some of the Rabbins of the middle ages. For the
sake of avoiding repetition, we refer the reader to the commentary, where the passages
pointing out the distinctions of persons are dwelt upon at large.

<p class="first">As we concur with those who seek “<i>nothing more than a general resemblance</i>” between the history recorded in this poem and the experience of the people of God,
we have merely to state here our reasons for rejecting their view of the narrative.
</p>
<p>No direct mention is made in any part of this long poem of the marriage ceremony,
nor of any circumstance connected with it. The bride is described as a shepherdess
and keeper of the vineyards (chap. i. 6; ii. 15; viii. 12, &amp;c.); as walking in the
streets in the night to seek her beloved, and as being beaten by the watchmen (iii.
1–4; v. 6, &amp;c.); which are incompatible with the notion that she was Pharaoh’s daughter,
or any other princess. Besides, the bridegroom is not a king, but a shepherd; Compare
chap. i. 7, ii. 8, and v. 2–4. These, and other considerations which might have been
mentioned, are entirely subversive of this nuptial theory.

<h3 class="main">SECTION VII.—AUTHOR, DATE, AND FORM OF THE BOOK.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The <i>title</i> of this poem designates Solomon as the author, but internal evidence is against it.
The writer mentions David in such a manner as if he were not his father (iv. 4). The
words, “Solomon <i>had</i> a vineyard,” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כֶּרֶם הָיָה לִשְלֹמֹה‎</span>) in viii. 11, show that the author was not a contemporary of Solomon. The subject,
especially of the poem, is decisive against Solomon’s authorship. It is impossible
that he should describe himself as having attempted to gain the espoused affections
of a country maiden, and being defeated by her virtue. The title is evidently the
addition of some other person; for the author of the book never uses the pronoun <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֲשֶׁר‎</span>, but invariably employs the form <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שׁ‎</span>; nor would he announce his own production as “<i>the finest or most celebrated Song</i>.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb125">[<a href="#pb125">125</a>]</span></p>
<p>The exact <i>date</i> of this poem has been much disputed. The powerful and fluent style in which it is
written, the originality of the figures, the freshness of the landscapes, the life-like
descriptions of local circumstances, the imagery drawn from the royal court of Solomon,
the horses of Pharaoh, the tower of David, the tower of Solomon, the pools of Heshbon,
show that the poem must have been written in the most flourishing age of the Hebrew
language, and about the time of Solomon. The Aramaisms, which used formerly to be
adduced in order to transfer the book to an age after the captivity, are now rightly
rejected by modern critics as inconclusive, since almost every poetical composition
of the earliest age contains such Aramaisms. The word <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פַּרְדֵס‎</span> (iv. 13), to which a Persian etymology has been assigned, and which has especially
been used to show the late period of this poem, is of a Shemitic origin. See Comment,
<i lang="la">in loco</i>. The form, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שׁ‎</span> for <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֲשֵׁר‎</span>, is also used in Judges v. 7, vi. 17, vii. 12, viii. 26, and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דָוִיד‎</span> with <i>god</i> in Amos vi. 5, ix. 11, Hos. iii. 5.
</p>
<p>The <i>form</i> of the book has also been a matter of great dispute. From its earliest age it has
been regarded as one continued poem in a dramatic form. Since the time of Richard
Simon, however, who pronounced this book, “<i lang="la">summam confusionem, in quo vix ac ne vix quidem personas discernere queas</i>,”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4867src" href="#xd31e4867">154</a> it has been split by many into fragments, and in turn been regarded as consisting
of a number of eclogues, or armorets, as an epithalamium, or nuptial song, and as
a regular drama. Having traced the unity of the poem in Section <span class="asc">III.</span>, we need not again show the unsoundness of the fragmentary theory, which originated
from a misunderstanding of the design of the book. It seems to approach nearest in
form to a <i>drama</i>. Yet we cannot think, with Ewald and others, that it is a regular <i>drama</i>. The genius, character, and manners of the Shemitic nations, their deficiency in
plastic art, and their aversion to females appearing on a public stage, seem to militate
against it.

<p class="footnote"><span class="fnlabel"><a class="noteRef" href="#xd31e466src">1</a></span> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אמר ר״ש בן עזאי מקובל אני מפי שבעים ושנים זקנים ביום שהושיבו את ר׳ אליעזרבן עוריה
בישובה ששיר השירם וקהלת מטמאים את הירים. אמר ר׳ עקיבה חם ושׁלום לא נחלק אדִם מישראל
עדֹ שיר השיריﬦ שלא תטמא את הידים שאין כל העולֹם כדאי כיום שכתן בו שיר השירים לישראל,
שכל הכובים קרש ושיר השירים קדש קושים.‎</span> As the phrase <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מטמא את הידים‎</span>, <i>polluting the hands</i>, has recently been quoted by Dr. Davidson (The Text of the Old Testament, &amp;c. p.
796), in direct contrariety to its meaning, we shall here give an explanation of it.
Let it be observed, that in the Mishna, whence the above passage is quoted, the phrase
is applied to <i>all</i> the Holy Scriptures (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כל כתבי הקדש מטמאין את הידים‎</span>). The reason of this is given in the Talmud, (Sabbath, 14 a,) where the question
is asked, why Holy Writ is reckoned among the eighteen subjects which are decreed
as <i>polluting the hands</i>? The answer there given is, because the Theruma-food and the Thorah, both being regarded
as holy, used to be placed near each other. When it was afterwards discovered that
the sacred books were thereby exposed to danger (damage by mice), the Rabbins decreed
that they should henceforth be regarded as <i>unclean</i>, in order to prohibit them from coming in contact with those sacred eatables. Hence
the decree <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כל כתבי הקדש מטמאין את הידים‎</span>, <i>all Holy Scripture pollutes the hands</i>, which exclusively applies to <i>holy</i>, i.e. inspired books. Wherever, therefore, it is said that a book is <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מטמא את הידים‎</span>, <i>polluting the hands</i>, it affirms that it is canonical; and when it is said <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אין מטמא את הידים‎</span>, <i>it does not pollute the hands</i>, it means that the book is not canonical. Thus we are told <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שיר השירים מטמא את הידים שנאמר ברוח הקדש‎</span>, “the Song of Songs <i>pollutes the hands because it is inspired</i>.” And of the non-canonical <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ספר בן סיר׳ וכל הספרים שנכתבו מכאן ואליך אינן מטמאין את הידיﬦ‎</span>, “The book of the Son of Sirach, and all the books written from that time and afterwards,
<i>do not pollute the hands</i>.”&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd31e466src" title="Return to note 1 in text.">↑</a></p>

<p class="first">The scene of this division is in the royal tent of Solomon. The Shulamite, separated
from her beloved shepherd, longs to be reunited with him whom she prizes above all
things (2, 3). She implores him to come and rescue her; for, though brought by the
king into his royal tent, her love continues the same (4). She repels the scornful
reflection of the court ladies when they hear her soliloquy (5, 6). She implores her
lover to tell her where she may find him (7). The court ladies ironically answer this
request (8). Meanwhile the king comes in, and tries to win her affections by flatteries
and promises (9–11). This attempt fails, and she opposes to the king’s love her unabated
attachment to her beloved shepherd (12–ii. 6). In an ecstasy she adjures the court
ladies not to attempt to persuade her to love any one else (7).

<p class="first">Here we have a second scene, which is also in the royal tent. The speakers are the
Shulamite and the court ladies. The Shulamite, to account for the cause of the severity
of her brothers, mentioned in ii. 6, relates that her beloved shepherd came one charming
morning in the spring to invite her to the fields (8–14); that her brothers, in order
to prevent her from going, gave her employment in the gardens (15); that she consoled
herself with the assurance that her beloved, though separated from her at that time,
would come again in the evening (16, 17); that seeing he did not come, she, under
difficult circumstances, ventured to seek him, and found him (ch. iii. 1–4). Having
narrated these events, and reiterated her ardent affection for her beloved, she concludes
as before, by adjuring the court ladies not to persuade her to change her love.

<p class="first">The royal tent in the country is broken up, and the royal train comes up to Jerusalem.
Some of the inhabitants of the capital, as they behold it at a distance, hold a dialogue
respecting it (6–11). The shepherd, coming up to rescue his loved one, obtains an
interview with her, and expresses his delight in her charms (ch. iv. 1–5). The Shulamite
moved, modestly interrupts his description, and tells him that she is ready to escape
with him that very evening (6). He immediately proffers his assistance, declaring
that her charms had inspired him with courage sufficient for the occasion (7–9); he
describes her charms (10, 11) and her faithfulness (12–16). The Shulamite declares
that all she possesses shall be his (16). Some of the court ladies sympathize with
them (ch. v. 1).

<p class="first">The Shulamite relates to the court ladies a dream which she has had, in which she
manifests great attachment for her beloved (2–8). The court ladies, surprised at this
extraordinary enthusiasm, ask what there is particular in his person to cause such
an attachment (9). The Shulamite then gives a description of him (10–16). Whereupon
the court ladies inquire where he is, and offer to seek him (ch. vi. 1). The Shulamite,
suspecting their intention, gives an evasive answer to their inquiry (2, 3). The king,
having heard the Shulamite’s beloved mentioned, immediately comes forward and seeks
to win her affections (4–9); in exalting her beauty, he repeats how the court ladies
had praised her when they first saw her (10). The Shulamite, having explained how
she came to be seen by the court ladies, withdraws (11, 12.) The king calls her back
(ch. vii. 1); and, as she returns, describes her charms, and wishes to enjoy the love
of one so beautiful (2–10). The Shulamite refuses the king’s desire, stating that
her affections were espoused (11); then addressing herself to her beloved, she asks
him to go home with her, and descants upon their rural pleasures (12–14). Remembering,
however, that circumstances even at home prevented the full manifestation of her love,
she longs for those obstacles to be removed (ch. viii. 1, 2). Overcome by her feelings,
she wishes that none but her beloved may support her (3), and with the little strength
she has left, adjures the court ladies not to persuade her to change her love (4).

<p class="first">The Shulamite, released from the palace, returns to her native place with her beloved
(5). On their way home they visit the spot where they had been first pledged to each
other; and there they renew their vows (6, 7). On their arrival at the Shulamite’s
home, her brothers are reminded of the promise they had made to reward their sister’s
virtue (9, 10). The Shulamite mentions the greatness of her temptations, and her victory
over them (11, 12). The shepherds visit her, to whom she declares, according to request,
her unabated attachment to her beloved shepherd (13, 14).

<p class="first"><a href="#v1.2">2</a>. <i>Oh for a kiss</i>, &amp;c. That the speaker is a Shulamite shepherdess who had been separated by king Solomon
from her beloved, and that she desires to be reunited with him, is evident from verses
4, 7, 8; vii. 1, &amp;c. Excited by the pain of separation, the damsel wishes that her
beloved were present, that he could kiss her, for his caresses would cheer her fainting
heart more than the best of wines. Wine, either pure or mixed (see infra, vii. 3),
is often spoken of by the sacred and profane poets as delighting the hearts of both
gods and men, and reviving their drooping spirits. (Judges ix. 13; Ps. civ. 15; Prov.
xxxi. 6; Eccl. x. 19.) Hence Helen gave a bowl of mixed wine to her guests oppressed
with grief, to raise their spirits. (Hom. Odyss. iv. 220.) Yet the Shulamite declares
that she preferred the caresses of her beloved to this highly prized cordial.
</p>
<p>The imperfect form <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יִשַּׁקֵנִי‎</span> is used optatively or voluntatively, “Oh that he would kiss me!” (Gesen. § 127, 3
b; Ewald, § 224 a); <i>i.e.</i> a kiss: the subject, either in the singular (Gen. xxviii. 11, compare v. 18; Exod.
vi. <span class="pageNum" id="pb130n">[<a href="#pb130n">130</a>]</span>25; Ps. cxxxvii. 3), or plural (Gen. xxx. 14; Exod. xvii. 5; 2 Sam. xi. 17), is to
be supplied from the plural noun <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מִנְּשִׁיקוֹת‎</span>, as indicated by the <i>partitive</i> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מִן‎</span>. (Compare Gesen. § 154, 3 c; Ewald, § 217, b, i. b.) The singular, however, is preferable,
for the Shulamite does not wish so much for a <i>number</i> of kisses as for the presence of her beloved; <i>one</i> would be sufficient if he could only come. We thus obtain a phrase <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נָשָׁק נְשִׁיקָה‎</span>, <i>to kiss a kiss</i>, i.e. <i>to give a kiss</i>; corresponding to <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יָעַץ עֵצָה‎</span>, <i>to counsel a counsel</i>, i.e. <i>to give counsel</i>, 2 Sam. xvi. 23; <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חָלָה חֳלִי‎</span>, 2 Kings xiii. 14. This construction is of frequent occurrence in Hebrew, and is
also found in Greek and Latin; (Compare <span class="trans" title="nosein noson"><span lang="grc" class="grek">νοσεῖν νόσον</span></span>, <i>pugnam pugnare</i>; Gesen. § 138 i., Rem. 1; Ewald, § 281 a.) The rendering, therefore, of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מִן‎</span> by <i>with</i> (Luther, English Version, Good, Williams, &amp;c.) is incorrect. Ewald’s and Herxheimer’s
translation, <i>Let one of the kisses kiss me</i>, is both incongruous and ungrammatical; for in the first place, it is not the kiss
that kisses, but the individual; and secondly, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נְשִׁיקָה‎</span> is <i>feminine</i>, which would require <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תִּשַּׁקֵנִי‎</span>, the third fem. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דוֹדִים‎</span>, prop. <i>love</i>, the abstract, which, as in Greek and Latin, is in Hebrew frequently expressed by
the plural, (comp. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏<span class="corr" id="xd31e5807" title="Source: חַיִים">חַיִּים</span>‎</span>, <i>life</i>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מַמְתַּקִים‎</span>, <i>sweetness</i>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מַחִמַדִים‎</span>, <i>beauty</i>; <i>vide infra</i>, v. 16; Gesen. § 108, 2 a; Ewald, § 179 a), here metonomically for the expressions
of it—<i>love-tokens</i>, <i>caresses</i>. So Lee, Magnus, Noyes, Fürst, Philippson, &amp;c. This rendering is demanded by the
context, for this clause gives the cause of the statement in the preceding one. The
change from the <i>third</i> person <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יִשַּׁקֵנִי‎</span>, to the <i>second</i> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דֹדָיךָ‎</span>, or from the <i>second</i> to the <i>third</i> person, is an enallage of frequent occurrence in sacred poetry. (Deut. xxxii. 15;
Isa. i. 29; Jer. xxii. 24; Gesen. § 137, 3, Rem. 3.) The Sept. and Vulg. have <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דַּדֶּיךָ‎</span>, <i>thy breasts</i>, instead of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דֹדֶיךָ‎</span>, <i>thy caresses</i>. That this is a gross error is evident from the fact that <i>a man</i> and not <i>a woman</i> is here addressed. To appeal to the catachresis in Isa. lx. 16, would be preposterous.
</p>
<p><a href="#v1.3">3</a>. <i>Sweet is the odour</i>, &amp;c. Ointments, like wines, were used by the ancients as cordials (Prov. xxvii. 9),
and as restoratives in consequence of their supposed sanative properties. Hence the
anointing of the sick. (Isa. i. 6, &amp;c.; Jer. viii. 22.) The fainting Shulamite, therefore,
mentions this second cordial. The <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ל‎</span> in <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לְרֵיחַ‎</span> signifies <i>in</i>, <i>as regards</i>, <i>quoad</i>, and is frequently used for the sake of giving prominence to an idea. Thus “Solomon
was greater than all the kings of the earth <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לְעֹשֵׁר וּלְחָכְמָה‎</span>, <i>in</i> or <i>as regards</i> riches and wisdom.” (1 Kings x. 23.) Compare also Exod. xx. 5, 6; Ewald, § 217 a.
Fürst, Lexicon, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ל‎</span> 5, f. The Sept. has <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ו‎</span> instead of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ל‎</span>; or it may be, favours the view of Döpke, Heiligstedt, Meier, &amp;c., that the <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ל‎</span> introduces the nominative; but this requires another anomaly, viz., to refer <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏טוֹבִים‎</span>, to the <i lang="la">nomen rectum</i>, instead of <i lang="la">regens</i>, and does not at all improve the sense. The Syriac, Ibn Ezra, Authorized Version,
Percy, Williams, Noyes, &amp;c., take the <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ל‎</span> in the sense of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לְמַעַן‎</span>, <i>because</i>, and connect it with <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עַל כֵּן‎</span>, <i>therefore</i>, of the last clause; but these words are never used together for <i>cause</i> and <i>effect</i>. Besides, this explanation, like the former, interrupts the sense; for the fainting
damsel evidently refers here to the second restorative. Luther strangely renders this
clause, <i lang="de">dass man deine gute Salbe <span class="corr" id="xd31e5930" title="Source: riche">rieche</span></i>. Kleuker, Rosenmüller, Ewald, Delitzsch, Philippson, &amp;c., translate <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לְרֵיחַ‎</span> <i>to the smell</i>; but this is contrary to the <i lang="la">usus loquendi</i>, as <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רֵיחַ‎</span> is never used for the organ which <i>inhales</i>, but invariably means something <i>exhaled</i> or <i>emitted</i>. Hodgson renders <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לְרֵיחַ‎</span>, <i>like the scent</i>; but <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ל‎</span> never signifies <i>like</i>. The instance in Deut. xi. 18, adduced in support of his assertion, is gratuitous,
for the <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ל‎</span> in <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏<span class="corr" id="xd31e5967" title="Source: לטוֹטָפֹת">לְטוֹטָפֹת</span>‎</span> has not that meaning.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb131n">[<a href="#pb131n">131</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>Which perfume thou art, by thy name</i>, &amp;c. This clause is explanatory of the preceding one, “Sweet is the odour of thy
perfumes, because thou art that perfume.” The comparison of an agreeable person to
perfumes arose from the great requisition of aromatics in the East. In warm climates
perspiration is profuse, and much care is needful to prevent its offensiveness. Hence
the use of perfumes particularly at weddings, feasts, on visits to persons of rank
(2 Sam. xii. 20; Ps. xlv. 8; Prov. vii. 17; Amos vi. 6), and most of the occasions
which bring people together with the intention of being agreeable to one another.
Hence the pleasant odours diffused by perfumes soon became a metaphor to express the
attractions which an agreeable person throws around him (Eccl. vii. 1), just as an
offensive smell is used to express the contrary idea. (Gen. xxxiv. 30; Exod. v. 21.)
The word <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תּוּרַק‎</span>, being taken as <i>the third person fem.</i>, has greatly perplexed interpreters. For neither <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שֶׁמֶן‎</span>, to which the Sept., Ibn Ezra, Rashbam, Immanuel, &amp;c., refer it, nor <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שֵׁם‎</span>, to which it is referred by Ewald, Gesenius, &amp;c., ever occurs as feminine. Others,
to overcome this difficulty, have either taken <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תּוּרַק‎</span> as a <i>proper name</i> (Syria. R. Tobiah) or as an appellative (Bochart, Hieron. ii. 4, 26.) The true solution
seems to be that the word in question is not the third person feminine but <i>the second person masculine</i>. So Rashi, Michaelis, Hengstenberg, &amp;c. The words literally translated would be,
<i>like oil art thou poured forth, with regard to thy name</i>. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שִׁמְךָ‎</span>, is the second accusative, comp. Ps. lxxxiii. 19; Ewald, § 281, 3 c. The words <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שֶׁמֶן‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שֵׁם‎</span> form <i>a paranomasia</i>. This figure, which consists of words ranged together of similar sound, but differing
in sense, is frequently used in the Old Testament; and also occurs in the New. (Compare
<span class="trans" title="limoi kai loimoi"><span lang="grc" class="grek">λιμοὶ καὶ λοιμοὶ</span></span>, Luke xxi. 11, and Acts xvii. 25.)
</p>
<p><i>Therefore do the damsels love thee.</i> How natural for a woman, greatly admiring, and dotingly attached to her beloved,
to think that every damsel must be enamoured of him! The most probable derivation
of the much-disputed <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עַלְמָה‎</span>, is from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עָלָה‎</span> = <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עוּל‎</span>, <i>to come up</i>, <i>to grow up</i>; hence the Poel <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עוֹלֵל‎</span>, <i>a growth</i>, <i>a child</i>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עֶלֶם‎</span>, <i>one growing up</i>; with the termination <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏–ֶם‎</span>, (Compare <i>Alma</i>, in Latin, from <i>alo</i>, <span class="trans" title="aldō"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ἄλδω</span></span>, and Fürst, Lexicon, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מ‎</span> 2 c,) and the feminine <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עַלְמָה‎</span>, <i>a growing damsel</i>, without any reference to the idea of <i>virginity</i>, for which <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בְּתוּלָה‎</span> is invariably used; Joel i. 8, not excepted. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בַּעַל‎</span> is here used, not to indicate that the marriage was consummated, but because the
Jews regarded parties consecrated to each other from the very moment they were betrothed.
Hence Mary is called the <i>wife</i> of Joseph, and he her <i>husband</i>. (Compare Matt. i. 19, 20, &amp;c.) Other derivations assigned to <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עַלְמָה‎</span>, such as <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עָלַם‎</span> = <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חָלַם‎</span>, to be <i>fat</i>, <i>full</i>, <i>ripe</i>, <i>marriageable</i> (Gesenius, &amp;c.), or <i>being excited</i>, hence <i>youth</i> as being peculiarly subject to it (Lee); or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עָלַם‎</span>, <i>to hide</i>, <i>be concealed</i>, <i>unrevealed</i>, <i>unknown</i>; hence <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עֶלֶם‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עַלְמָה‎</span>, persons of a youthful age who were destitute of the knowledge which springs from
sexual intercourse (Henderson) are exceedingly forced. Jerome’s assertion, as also
Wordsworth’s, on Matt. i. 23, that <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עַלְמָה‎</span>, is the designation of a virgin, because it signifies <i>kept secret</i>, as a virgin is under the care of her parents, is gratuitous, for <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עַלְמָה‎</span>, is formed from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עֶלֶם‎</span>, <i>a young man</i>, of whom this cannot be said.
</p>
<p><a href="#v1.4">4</a>. <i>Oh draw me</i>, &amp;c. The Shulamite wishes that her beloved should not only come and cheer her fainting
heart with the tokens of his love, but take her away altogether. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אַחֲרֶיךָ‎</span> belongs to <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מָשְׁכֵנִי‎</span>. (Compare Job xxi. 33.) So the Chaldee, Immanuel, Luther, Mendelssohn, Kleuker, Percy,
Hodgson, Ewald, Meier, Hitzig, Philippson, &amp;c. The Septuagint renders <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מָשְׁכֵנִי‎</span>, by <span class="trans" title="heilkysan se"><span lang="grc" class="grek">εἵλκυσάν σε</span></span>, mistaking it for <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מְשָׁכוּךָ‎</span>, and adds <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לְרֵיחַ שְׁמָנֶידָ‎</span> after <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אַחֲרֶיךָ‎</span>, evidently <span class="pageNum" id="pb132n">[<a href="#pb132n">132</a>]</span>an interpolation from the first clause of the third verse, which the Vulgate, Percy,
&amp;c., follow.
</p>
<p><i>The king has brought me</i>, &amp;c. It was the king, she tells us, who brought her into his apartments, and thus
separated her from her beloved, in whom, however, she still delights. That this is
the import of this clause is obvious from the words and connexion. The Shulamite began
with invoking her absent beloved in the <i>third</i> person; but no sooner had she expressed her desire to be with him, than he is, as
it were, present to her mind, and she forthwith, dropping the third person, addresses
him in the <i>second</i>, and so continues to speak to him throughout the third verse. She begins the fourth
verse in the same way, imploring her beloved, in the <i>second</i> person, to take her away, telling him that “<i>the king</i>, ‘<span class="asc">HE</span>,’ <i>has brought her into his apartments</i>” (mark the change from the <i>second</i> to the <i>third</i> person); and then continues and finishes her address to her beloved in the second
person. Now we ask, do not the words <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏<span class="corr" id="xd31e6196" title="Source: הֶבִיאַנִי">הֱבִיאַנִי</span> הַמֶּלֶךְ חֲדָרָיו‎</span>, <i>the king</i>, “<span class="asc">HE</span>,” <i>has brought me into his apartments</i>, placed between <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מָשְׁכֵנִי אַחֲרֶיךָ‎</span>, <i>do</i> “<span class="asc">THOU</span>” <i>draw me after thee</i>, and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נָגִילָה וְנִשְׂמְחָה בָּךְ וגו׳‎</span>, <i>we exult and rejoice in</i> “<span class="asc">THEE</span>,” &amp;c., clearly show that the king here referred to is a <i>separate</i> person from the beloved to whom the maiden is addressing herself? We venture to affirm
that few readers of the original Hebrew, whose minds are not biassed by a preconceived
theory, can carefully peruse these three verses without observing that <span class="asc">TWO</span> persons are here introduced—viz. <i>the beloved to whom</i>, and <i>the king of whom</i>, the damsel speaks. Ibn Ezra, Immanuel, the Anonymous MS. Commentary, &amp;c., could
not help seeing this, and explained the passage, “Were even the king to bring me into
his apartments, I should rejoice and be glad in thee” (the shepherd). The Septuagint,
which is followed by the Vulgate, has again <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דַּדֶּיךָ‎</span>, <i>thy breast</i>, instead of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דֹדֶיךָ‎</span>, <i>thy love</i>; but see supra, ver. 2.
</p>
<p><i>The upright love thee.</i> The word <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מֵישָׁרִים‎</span>, is explained by Rashi, Rashbam, Döpke, De Wette, Rosenmüller, Gesenius, &amp;c., by
<i>sincerely</i>, <i>uprightly</i>; Ibn Ezra, who is followed by Houbigant, takes it as an adjective for wine, <i>i.e.</i> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יַיִן הֹלֵך לְמַישָׁרִים‎</span>, <i>wine that glides down smoothly</i>; and Ewald, Boothroyd, Magnus, Hitzig, &amp;c., render it <i>deservedly</i>, <i>justly</i>. As for <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֲהֵבוּךָ‎</span>, it is either referred to <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עֲלָמוֹת‎</span>, <i>the damsels love thee more than wine</i> (Ibn Ezra); or is taken impersonally, i.e. <i>thou art sincerely</i> or <i>deservedly beloved</i>. (Ewald, Magnus, &amp;c.) But this is against the structure of these verses. For the
second and third verses, consisting of five members, form one stanza, finishing with
the words <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עֲלָמוֹת אֲהֵבוּךָ‎</span>; and it is evident that the fourth verse, also consisting of five members, is of
the same structure, and that the concluding words <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מֵישָׁרִים אֲהֵבוּךָ‎</span>, are intended to correspond to those at the end of the first stanza. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מֵישָׁרִים‎</span>, therefore, must be taken as a parallelism with <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עֲלָמוֹת‎</span>, and means <i>the upright</i>. So the Septuagint (<span class="trans" title="euthytēs ēgapēse se"><span lang="grc" class="grek">εὐθύτης ἠγάπησέ σε</span></span>, the abstract for concrete), Symmachus, (<span class="trans" title="hoi eutheis hoi agapōntes se"><span lang="grc" class="grek"><span class="corr" id="xd31e6309" title="Source: οἰ">οἱ</span> εὐθεῖς <span class="corr" id="xd31e6313" title="Source: οἰ αγαπάντες">οἱ αγαπῶντές</span> σε</span></span>,) the Vulgate (<span lang="la">recti diligant te</span>), the Chaldee (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צַדִּיקָיָא רְחִימוּ‎</span>), English Version (margin), Mendelssohn, Philippson, &amp;c. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מֵישָׁרִים‎</span>, <i>the upright</i>, is designedly chosen in preference to <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עֲלָמוֹת‎</span>, <i>damsels</i>, in order to give an indirect and gentle blow to him who had separated her from her
beloved. “<span class="sc">Thee</span>, the upright, and not the seduced love.”
</p>
<p><a href="#v1.5">5</a>. <i>I am swarthy</i>, &amp;c. The court ladies, indignant at this statement, looked with affected disdain
upon the <span class="pageNum" id="pb133n">[<a href="#pb133n">133</a>]</span>discoloured rustic girl. The Shulamite repels these disdainful looks, for she knows
that, though swarthy, she is comely, else the king would not have noticed her. A similar
idea occurs in Theocritus (Idyl. x. 26–29), where Bambyce, though sun-burnt, is called
beautiful.

<p class="first">Compare also Virgil, Eclog. x. 38. The comparison between the dark complexion and
the tents of the Kedareens, and between the comeliness and the pavilions of Solomon,
arose from the custom of nomades and travellers in the East of carrying with them
moveable tents, which were temporarily pitched for the purpose of the pernoctation
or protection against meridian sun. The tents of the Kedareens, a nomadic tribe of
North Arabia (Gen. xxv. 13; Isa. xxi. 17), were and still are to this day made of
coarse cloth, obtained from the shaggy hair of their black goats (Rosenmüller, Orient.
iv. 939; Saalschütz, <span lang="de">Archäologie der Hebräer, Erster Theil</span>, p. 63). Whereas, the curtains of which Solomon’s pavilion was constructed were,
most probably, very fine and beautiful. From this passage, confirmed by chap. iii.
6, and vi. 12, we see that this scene took place in the royal tent of Solomon, pitched
in the open air of some favourite spot to which the king resorted in the summer. It
is still the custom of Oriental potentates to go once a-year to some attractive neighbourhood,
where they erect their magnificent tents, which serve as their temporary abodes. (Morier,
<span lang="de">Zweite Reise in <span class="corr" id="xd31e6414" title="Source: Persian">Persien</span></span>, p. 223; Jaubert, Voyage, p. 334). <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שְׁחוֹרָה‎</span>, <i>swarthy</i>, refers to <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ﬡָהֳלֵי קֵדָר‎</span>, <i>the tents of Kedar</i>, and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נָאוָה‎</span>, <i>comely</i>, to <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יְרִעוֹת שְׁלֹמֹה‎</span> <i>the pavilion of Solomon</i>. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נָﬡוָה‎</span>, a contraction of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נָﬡֲוָה‎</span>, from the root <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נָﬡָה‎</span>, is formed from the Pilel. The third radical, which this conjugation requires to
be doubled, appears in this and in two other words, under the form <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏וה‎</span>. Compare <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שָׁחַה‎</span>, <i>to bow</i>, Pilel, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שָׁחֲוָה‎</span>, hence the reflexive <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הִשְׁתַּחֲוָה‎</span>, <i>to bow</i>, or <i>prostrate oneself</i>; <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מְטַחֲוִים‎</span>, <i>archers</i>, Gen. xxi. 16; Gesen. § 75, Rem. 18; Ewald, § 121 c. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יְרִעָה‎</span>, prop. <i>a vail</i>, <i>a curtain of a tent</i>, Exod. xxvi. 12, and metonomically for the tent itself, 2 Sam. vii. 2; 1 Chron. xvii.

which the Church compares herself to set forth her comeliness. Hodgson, misunderstanding
the figure, absurdly renders <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כְּאָהֳלֵי קֵדָר‎</span>, <i>like the spices of Kedar</i>, and makes the Shulamite compare herself to the odoriferous trees and beautiful figures
in the (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יְרִיעוֹת‎</span>), fine tapestry.
</p>
<p><a href="#v1.6">6</a>. <i>Disdain me not.</i> In repelling these disdainful looks the Shulamite states first that her dark complexion
is adventitious, being merely sun-burnt, and as Rashi remarks, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נוח להתלבן כשיעמוד בצל‎</span>, will be white again under the protection of the shade: and secondly, how she came
to be so much exposed to the sun, and this she ascribes to the anger of her brothers.
This anger, however, as it appears from ii. 8–17, was merely a fraternal solicitude
for her reputation, which induced them to give her employment in the vineyards, in
order to prevent her meeting her beloved in the field. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אַל תִּרְאוּנִי‎</span> (<i><abbr title="idem quod">i.q.</abbr></i> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אַל תִּרְאֲֽינָה אֹתִי‎</span>, Ewald, § 248), <span class="pageNum" id="pb134n">[<a href="#pb134n">134</a>]</span>is well explained by the Chald., Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Rashbam, Immanuel, &amp;c., <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אלֹ תבזוני‎</span>, <i>do not disdain me</i>. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רָאָה‎</span>, <i>to see</i>, is also used for <i>looking down</i> upon any one, Job. xli. 26. Instead of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תִּרְאֻנִי‎</span>, four of Kennicott’s MSS., two of De Rossi’s, and two more, originally read <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תיראוני‎</span>, <i>fear</i> me not, which is adopted by Döderlein; but the reading of the received text is both
more supported, and suits the connexion better; for it can hardly be possible that
the damsel was actually so black as to inspire terror; or that the court ladies were
so highly nervous as to be so easily frightened. Hodgson’s rendering, <i>mind me not</i>, is incorrect. The <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ש‎</span> in <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שֶׁאֲנִי‎</span>, stands for <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֲשֶׁר‎</span>, the <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏א‎</span> being rejected by aphaeresis, and the <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ר‎</span> assimilated; Gesen. § 36. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שְׁחַרְחֹר‎</span>, <i>blackish</i>; adjectives denoting colour have frequently the last two stem letters repeated to

</p>
<p><i>Though my own vineyard</i>, &amp;c. The word <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כַּרְמִי‎</span>, is either taken to denote the Shulamite’s <i>personal appearance</i>, or to mean <i>her beloved</i>: and the phrase is explained, “Through the constant watch which my brothers made
me keep over their vineyard, I could not take care of (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כַּרְמִי‎</span>) <i>my complexion</i>; or could not attend to (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כַּרְמִי‎</span>) <i>my beloved</i>.” But it is a hazardous mode of interpretation to take an expression in the same
verse in an <i>ordinary</i> and in an <i>extraordinary</i> sense, which ought never to be done unless required by absolute necessity, which
is not the case here. Dr. Good indeed escapes this inconsistency by assigning a spiritual
meaning to <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כֶּרֶם‎</span>, (viz. personal estate, one’s own person) in both clauses; and he submits that “the
bride asserts that she had been compelled to neglect her own person, through the perpetual
attention which was demanded of her by her brothers or sisters in decorating themselves,
or in assisting in their concerns.” But apart from the unnecessary and unjustifiable
deviation from the literal meaning, this interpretation is entirely at variance with
the context. For in the words, “They have made me keeper of their vineyards,” the
Shulamite evidently means to explain how she came to be exposed to the tanning sun.
Whereas, the supposition of her perpetual attention to the adornment of her brothers,
fails to account for the brown complexion. If however, with Ibn Ezra, we take these
words to explain the severity of her brothers, everything will be plain and unforced.
The damsel says, “My brothers were so angry—so severe with me that, resolved to carry
out their purpose, they made me keep their vineyards, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ובתחילה קורם זה אפילו כרמי שלי לא נטרתי‎</span>, a thing which I had never done before, even to my own vineyard. It is utterly inconceivable
how those who maintain that this Song celebrates the marriage of Solomon with <span class="pageNum" id="pb135n">[<a href="#pb135n">135</a>]</span>the daughter of Pharaoh can reconcile it with the facts that the damsel’s dark complexion
is here described as <i>adventitious</i>; whereas the Egyptians, even of the highest and most secluded classes, are <i>naturally</i> dark, and that she has been made <i>keeper of the vineyards</i>, which would ill agree with any prince’s daughter. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כֶּרֶם‎</span> is most probably derived from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כָּרָה‎</span> = <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כּוּר‎</span>, <i>to dig</i>, hence a garden cultivated by means of axes and spades in contradistinction to fields
worked with ploughs and harrows. (Compare Saalschütz, <span lang="de">Archäologie der <span class="corr" id="xd31e6712" title="Source: Hebraër">Hebräer</span></span>, vol. i. p. 119.) For the term. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏–ֶם‎</span> <i lang="la">vide supra</i>, p. 131. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שֶׁלִי‎</span>, <i>i.q.</i> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֲשֶׁר לִי‎</span> is used emphatically after <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כַּרִמִי‎</span>, to mark the contrast, and not, as Houbigant erroneously supposes, in the sense of
<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בשלי‎</span>, <i lang="fr">tranquillè</i>, <i>mine own vineyard I kept not quietly</i>.
</p>
<p><a href="#v1.7">7</a>. <i>Tell me, O thou</i>, &amp;c. Having repelled the disdainful looks of the court ladies, the Shulamite now
resumes her address to her beloved; so that this verse is intimately connected with
the fourth; and verses five and six are, as it were, parenthetical. Is it not surprising
that some can read this verse, and yet believe that the king was the object of the
damsel’s attachment, when this shows so clearly that it was a shepherd? The violent
heat of noonday compels people in the East to desist from labour, and recline in some
cool part of the house (2 Sam. iv. 5). Shepherds especially, being more exposed to
the burning rays of the sun, lead their flocks under some shady tree near wells and
streams. (Gen. xxix. 7; Ps. xxiii.; Isa. xix. 10.) We have beautiful descriptions
of the same custom by Greeks and Romans. Thus Virgil, Georg. iii. 331—

Jer. xiv. 3; Mal. iii. 7); and of <i>wandering</i> or <i>roaming</i> (Philippson, comp. Jer. xliii. 12). But wherever covering is used to signify <i>mourning</i> or <i>shame</i>, the <i>part of the body</i> usually <i>covered</i>, in order to indicate the existence of the emotion, is invariably stated. Equally
untenable is the rendering of <i>harlot</i>; for Tamar covered her face, not as a sign that she was a prostitute, but to <i>disguise</i> herself, so that she might not be recognised, and Judah took her to be a harlot because
she <i>sat by the way side</i>, Comp. Jer. iii. 2. Ewald renders it like <i>one unknown</i>; but this, to say the least, is remote from the context; <span class="pageNum" id="pb136n">[<a href="#pb136n">136</a>]</span>Gesenius, like <i>one fainting</i>; but this incurs the same objection. The explanation of Philippson would have been
the most plausible, if Rashbam and the anonymous MS. had not shown that <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עָטַה‎</span> itself means <i>to roam</i>, <i>to wander</i>, by referring to Isa. xxii. 17, where, according to its parallel, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏טוּל‎</span>, <i>to cast down</i>, it must signify to <i>roll about</i>. This meaning bests suits the context here, and is confirmed by Symach., Vulg., Syriac,
Chald.
</p>
<p><a href="#v1.8">8</a>. <i>If thou knowest not.</i> The court ladies, hearing the rustic girl say that she wished to be with her shepherd,
tell her ironically to go, and be employed in the low and toilsome occupation of a
shepherdess, rather than enjoy the exalted and easy life of a royal favourite. Some
have put this answer into the mouth of the beloved; but it is evident from v. 9, and
vi. 1, the only two places where the appellation “fairest of women” occurs, that it
is the reply of the court ladies, which even Döpke, Good and Noyes, the defenders
of the fragmentary theory, admit. Nothing can be more plain and incontrovertible than
the statement in this verse, that the damsel is <i>a shepherdess</i>, and the beloved <i>a shepherd</i>, whom, she is told, she would find among his fellow-shepherds. It is for those who
maintain the theory that this Song celebrates the marriage of Solomon with the daughter
of Pharaoh, or some other prince’s daughter, to get over this fact. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לֹא יָדָע‎</span> is unnecessarily and incorrectly rendered by Ewald, Meier, Hitzig, &amp;c., <i>unwise</i>. The Sept., which is followed by Luther, mistaking the usage of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לָדְ‎</span>, translates this clause <span class="trans" title="ean mē gnōn seautēn"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ἐὰν μὴ γνῷν σεαυτήν</span></span>, as if the original were <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אִם לֹא תֵדְעִי אֶת נִפְשֶׁךָ‎</span>.

Besides the several modes of expressing the superlative
adduced by Gesenius, § 119, 2, this degree is sometimes also expressed by the positive
and the prepo. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ב‎</span> prefixed to the noun designating the class to which the person or thing compared
belongs: thus <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אַלְפִי הַדַּל בִּמְנַשֶׁה‎</span>, <i>my family is the weakest in Manasseh</i>, Judg. xvi. 5; Prov. xxx. 30, comp. also <span class="trans" title="eulogēmenē sy en gynaixin"><span lang="grc" class="grek">εὐλογημένη συ ἐν γυναιξίν</span></span>, <i>thou art the most blessed of women</i>, Luke i. 28, Ewald, § 313 c.
</p>
<p><a href="#v1.9">9</a>. <i>To my steed</i>, &amp;c. The court-ladies having turned from her and told her to go back to her menial
employment, her severest trial begins. The king, having watched his opportunity, enters
at that moment, and thus begins his flattering address. He first praises her beauty
and gracefulness by comparing her to his stately and noble chariot steed. The anonymous
MS. commentary rightly remarks, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מוסב למעל שאמרה שחורה אנו והוא אמר לה דמיתיך לסוסתי ברכבי פרעה שהם שחורים וסוס השחור
יפה הוא יותר משאר סוסים‎</span>, that this simile was suggested by the reference which the damsel has made in the
preceding verse to her dark complexion. The king, therefore, compares her to his noble
steed, whose dark colour renders it more beautiful than the other horses. Such a comparison
must have been very striking and flattering in the East, where this animal was so
much celebrated for its preeminent beauty. “A young chestnut mare,” says Layard, Nineveh,
<span class="pageNum" id="pb137n">[<a href="#pb137n">137</a>]</span>i. 91, “belonging to the sheik, was one of the most beautiful creatures I ever beheld.
As she struggled to free herself from the spear to which she was tied, she showed
the lightness and elegance of the gazelle. Her limbs were in perfect symmetry; her
ears long, slender, and transparent; her nostrils high, dilated and deep red, her
neck gracefully arched; and her mane and texture of silk.… No one can look at the
horses of the early Assyrian sculptures without being convinced that they were drawn
from the finest models.” Compare also the exquisite and inimitable description of
this noble animal in Job xxxix. 19, &amp;c. and Rosenmüller, Orient. iv. 941. The same
comparison is used by the Greek and Roman poets. Thus Theocritus, Idyl. xviii. 30,
31:—

<p class="first">Compare also Horace, Ode iii. 11. This shows the futility both of those who affirm
that the strangeness of the simile is against the literal meaning of this Song, and
of those who accuse the writer of uncouthness. Besides, is this comparison more strange
or uncouth than that of a man with <i>a bony ass</i>? (Gen. xlix. 14.) Mark also the other comparison used in the same chapter, such as
of an <i>ox</i>, <i>serpent</i>, &amp;c. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏סוּסָה‎</span> is not <i lang="la">equitatus</i>, (Vulg.

a well-known and celebrated mare which Solomon possessed and highly prized, and which
he always put into one of Pharaoh’s chariots. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בְּרִכְבֵי פַרְעֹה‎</span>, <i>one</i> of Pharaoh’s chariots, like <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בְּעָרֵי גִלְעָד‎</span>, <i>one</i> of the cities of Gilead. Judg. xii. 7.
</p>
<p>10, 11. <i>Beautiful is thy countenance</i>, &amp;c. The flattering praises are followed by enticing promises. “Thou art indeed beautiful,”
says the tempting king, “even in humble ornaments, but thou shalt have more costly
adornments, which will show off thy beauty to greater advantage.” The mention of the
noble steed which was adorned with costly trappings, contributing so much to its stately
and elegant appearance, naturally suggested the reference here made to the damsel’s
ornaments. The reader will not fail to observe that it is not the shepherd, but the
king who is speaking in verses 9–11. The poor shepherd had no prancing steed, no Egyptian
chariots; he could not promise the shepherdess such costly ornaments as are here described.
<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תּוֹרים‎</span> (from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תּוּר‎</span>, <i>to go round</i>, hence <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תּוֹר‎</span>, <i>something round</i>, <i>a circle</i>, Esth. ii. 12, 15,) <i>small rings</i> or <i>beads</i> strung upon threads, worn as a head-dress. It is customary in the East for women
to wear strings of beads hanging down from the temples over the cheeks. Rosenmüller,
Orient. iv. 942. Niebuhr, Reise nach Arab. i. 163. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לְחָיַיִם‎</span>, <i>cheeks</i> (dual of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏<span class="corr" id="xd31e7081" title="Source: לְהִי">לְחִי</span>‎</span>), by a synecdoche for <i>the whole face</i>. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חֲרוּזִים‎</span> (from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חָרַז‎</span>, <i>to pierce</i>, <i>to perforate</i>), <i>little perforated balls</i>, or <i>beads</i> strung upon a thread and worn around the neck; <i>i.q.</i> <i>a necklace</i>. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תּוֹרִים‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חֲרוּזִים‎</span> are plurals, because the circlet and necklace consisted of many composite parts.
Whether the circlet was of gold or brass, or whether the necklace consisted of real
pearls, corals, or steel, the etymology of the words does not at all intimate. The
context alone must decide this. The fact that the Shulamite was a humble rustic girl,
and that Solomon promises to present to her a <i>golden</i> circlet with <i>silver</i> studs, proves that they were of a common <span class="pageNum" id="pb138n">[<a href="#pb138n">138</a>]</span>description. This is another proof that the bride was not a prince’s daughter; since
her ornaments were not even of gold or silver, notwithstanding the impassionate desire
of Eastern ladies for costly adornments. The Sept. and Vulg. have <span class="trans" title="hōs trygones"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ὡς τρυγόνες</span></span>, <i>i.e.</i> “thy neck is as beautiful as doves, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כַּתּוֹרִים‎</span>; they have also <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כַּחֲרוּזִים‎</span>, <i>like a necklace</i>; but they have evidently mistaken the <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ב‎</span> for <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כ‎</span>, as well as the meaning of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תּוֹר‎</span>.

<p><a href="#v1.12">12</a>. <i>While the king is at his table.</i> Here we see how signally the first attempt of Solomon failed to win the affections
of the Shulamite. For no sooner did he go to his repast than the damsel indulges in
sweet expressions of love with her beloved shepherd. Two distinct persons are here
spoken of; <i>the king</i> at the table, and <i>a beloved shepherd</i>, called “nard.” That by the expression <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏<span class="corr" id="xd31e7160" title="Source: נֵרְדִי">נִרְדִי</span>‎</span>, <i>my nard</i>, the Shulamite means her beloved is evident from the following verse, where, led

It was obtained from India by way of Arabia and
Southern Asia. The perfume extracted from it was highly prized. Thus we are told (Mark
xiv. 31), when the Saviour sat at meat in Bethany, “there came a woman having an alabaster
box of ointment of spikenard <i>very precious</i>, and she broke the box, and poured it upon his head,” (comp<span class="corr" id="xd31e7254" title="Not in source">.</span> also John xii. 31,) which Judas, the betrayer, estimated at three hundred pence,
about eight pounds ten shillings. The Romans considered this perfume so precious that
Horace promises Virgil a whole cadus, about nine gallons, of wine for a small onyx-box
full of spikenard. See Pliny, Hist. Nat. xiii. 2; Sir W. Jones, Asiatic Researches,

<p><a href="#v1.13">13</a>. <i>A bag of myrrh</i>, &amp;c. This appellation is a continuation of the figurative expression “nard,” under
which the Shulamite described her beloved in the preceding verse. The Hebrew women
were in the habit of wearing little bags or bottles filled with perfumes, especially
with myrrh, suspended from the neck, and hanging down between their breasts, under
the dress. Comp. Mishna, Sabbath vi. 3; Schroeder de Vestit. Mulier. p. 155; Hartmann,
Hebr. ii. 235. The Shulamite says that her beloved is to her what this delightful
perfume is to others; having him she did not require any other fragrance. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צְרֹר‎</span> (from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צָרַר‎</span>, <i>to tie up</i>, <i>to close</i>), is <i>a leather smelling-bag</i> or <i>bottle</i>, i.q. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בֵּית נֶפֶשׁ‎</span>, tied up, or closed at the top. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מֹר‎</span>, <span class="trans" title="smyrna"><span lang="grc" class="grek">σμύρνα</span></span>, <span class="trans" title="myrrha"><span lang="grc" class="grek">μύῤῥα</span></span>, <i>Balsamodendron myrrha</i>, (from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מָרַר‎</span>, <i>to flow</i>,) <i>myrrh</i>, so called from its flowing down, is a perfume obtained from a shrub growing in Arabia,
and much more profusely in Abyssinia. It formed an article of earliest commerce, was
highly prized by the ancients, and is still much esteemed both in the East and in
Europe. This aromatic liquid either exudes spontaneously <span class="pageNum" id="pb139n">[<a href="#pb139n">139</a>]</span>from cracks in the bark, and is called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מוֹר עֹבֵר‎</span>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מוֹר דְרוֹר‎</span>, <i>stilicidious</i> or <i>profluent myrrh</i> (vide infra, v. 5; Exod. xxx. 23), and on that account is esteemed superior; or is
elicited artificially by bruises or incisions made with stones, and is therefore regarded
as inferior. It was used for incense (Exod. xxx. 23), for perfuming dresses (Ps. xlv.
9), and couches (Prov. vii. 17), for the purification of women (Esth. ii. 12), for
embalming dead bodies (John xix. 39), and was worn by women in the bosom. See Pliny,
lib. xii. cap. 35; Rosenmüller, Altherth. iv. 1, 159; Winer, Bib. Dict.; Kitto, Cyclop.
Bib. Lit. s.v. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בֵּן שָׁדַי יָלִין‎</span> is a relative clause, with <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֲשֶׁר‎</span> implied (See Gesen. § 123, 3; Ewald, § 332), and refers to <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צְרֹר הַמֹּר‎</span>. This is evident from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בְּכַרְמֵי עֵין נֶּדִי‎</span>, which refers to <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֶשְׁכֹּל הַכֹּפֶר‎</span>; comp. also iv. 4. The verb <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לוּן‎</span> is not here, “lie all night,” but <i>to abide</i>, <i>to rest</i>, like Job xix. 4, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אִתִּי תָלִין מְשׁוּגָתִי‎</span>, where even the Authorized Version has “mine error <i>remaineth</i> with myself.” Ps. xlix. 13.
</p>
<p><a href="#v1.14">14</a>. <i>A bunch of cypress flowers</i>, &amp;c. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כֹּפֶר‎</span> is unanimously regarded by the ancient versions and the Rabbins to denote the plant
called <span class="trans" title="kypros"><span lang="grc" class="grek">κύπρος</span></span> by the Greek, and <i>Al-henna</i> by the Arabs. This plant, which grows in many places, both in Palestine and Egypt,
(Plin. Hist. Nat. xii. 24,) is a tall shrub, growing from the height of eight to ten
feet; it is exceedingly beautiful and odoriferous. “The dark colour of its bark, the
light green of its foliage, the softened mixture of white and yellow, with which the
flowers, collected into long clusters like the lilac, are coloured, the red tint of
the ramifications which support them,—form a combination the effect of which is highly
agreeable. The flowers, whose shades are so delicate, diffuse around the most grateful
odours, and embalm with their strong fragrance the gardens in which they grow, and
the apartments which they beautify.… The women take pleasure in adorning their persons
and apartments with those delightful blossoms.” See Pliny, lib. xii. c. 14; Rosenmüller,
Bib. Miner. and Bot.; Winer, Bib. Dict.; Kitto, Cyclop. Bib. Lit. s.v. The flowers
grow in dense clusters, whence <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֶשְׁכֹּל הַכֹּפֶר‎</span>, <i>cluster of cypress flowers</i>. En-gedi, more anciently called Hazezon-Tamar, which modern explorers identify with
the present Ain-Jidy, abounded with the best of those delightful shrubs, (Winer, Bib.
Dict.; Kitto, Cyclop. Bib. Lit. s.v.; Robinson, Palest, ii. 209–216.) Hence this beautiful
appellation, “a bunch of cypress flowers,” than which nothing could be more expressive
of sweetness and beauty to an Oriental. The word <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֶשְׁכֹּל‎</span> is most probably derived from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אָשַׁךְ‎</span>, <i>to bind</i>, <i>to twine together</i>; hence <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֶשֶׁךְ‎</span>, <i>a bundle</i>, <i>a string</i>, with the addition of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏–ֹל‎</span> like <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גִבְעֹל‎</span>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חַרְגֹּל‎</span>, Gesen. § 30, 3; Ewald, § 163 f.

</p>
<p><a href="#v1.15">15</a>. <i>Behold, thou art beautiful.</i> That is, “It is not I who possess such attraction, it is thou who art beautiful,
yea superlatively beautiful!” The repetition of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הִנָךְ יָפָה‎</span> enhances the idea. “<i>Thine eyes are doves</i>,” i.e. “Thine eyes, in which ‘the rapt soul is sitting,’ beams forth the purity and
constancy of the dove.” As the eye is the inlet of ideas to the mind, so it is also
the outlet of inward feelings. Thus it expresses many of the passions, such as pity,
mildness, humility, anger, envy, pride, &amp;c.; hence the phrases <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עַין טוֹב‎</span> (which we also have), to look with an eye of compassion, Prov. xxii. <span class="pageNum" id="pb140n">[<a href="#pb140n">140</a>]</span>9; <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עַיִן רַע‎</span>, <span class="trans" title="ophthalmos ponēros"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ὀφθαλμὸς πονηρὸς</span></span>, <i>an evil eye</i>, Deut. xv. 9, Mark vii. 22. The dove is the emblem of purity and constancy. Ps. lvi.
1; Matt. x. 16. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עֵינַיִךְ יוֹנִים‎</span> are taken by the Syriac, Vulg., Ibn Ezra, Rashbam, Immanuel, Luther, Authorized Version,
Kleuker, Percy, Gesenius, Döpke, Rosenmüller, Meier, &amp;c. as an ellipsis for <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עֵינֶיךָ עֵינֵי יוֹנִים‎</span>, <i>thine eyes are doves’ eyes</i>. Gesen. § 144, Rem. Ewald, § 296, b. But such an ellipsis can be tolerated only in
extreme emergencies, whereas here the natural construction yields an excellent sense.
Besides, v. 2 proves that the doves themselves, and not the eyes, are the point of
comparison, just as the hair and the teeth are (iv. 1, 2) compared to the goats and
sheep themselves, and not merely to their hair and teeth. And <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עֵינַיִךְ בְרֵכוֹת‎</span> (vii. 4), which does not mean, <i>thou hast fish-ponds eyes</i>, but, <i>thine eyes are like the fish-ponds themselves</i>. Hence the Sept., Chald., Rashi, Mendelssohn, Hodgson, Ewald, Umbreit, Magnus, Williams,
Hengstenberg, <span class="corr" id="xd31e7479" title="Source: Phillipson">Philippson</span>, Hitzig, rightly reject this elliptical construction.
</p>
<p><a href="#v1.16">16</a>. <i>Behold, thou art comely.</i> The Shulamite, refusing to receive all the praise, responds: “It is <i>thou</i> who art lovely and attractive;” and referring to their meeting-spot, she adds, “Lovely
is our flowery couch; the arches of our bowers are formed of the spreading and interweaving
branches of the majestic and odoriferous cedars and cypresses.” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נָעִים‎</span> is to be mentally supplied before <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עַרְשֵׂנוּ רַעֲנָנָה‎</span>; comp. Prov. iii. 11, i.e. <i>Yea, lovely is our verdant couch</i>. The adj. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רַעֲנָנָה‎</span> is formed from the Pilel of the verb<span id="xd31e7502"></span> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רָעַן‎</span>. This conjugation, which is formed by doubling the third radical (see supra, 5),
is used to describe permanent states or conditions, or some striking property; comp.

Rashbam has therefore rightly rendered it
<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אחד מבניני הבית‎</span>, <i>one of the apartments of the house</i>. As however the house here described is <i>a bower</i>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רָהִיט‎</span> would be an <i>arbour</i>. The etymology of the word is in keeping with this sense. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רָהָט‎</span>, <i>i.q.</i> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רְהַט‎</span> = <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רוּץ‎</span>, <i>to run</i>, <i>to flow</i>, hence <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רַהַט‎</span>, 1. a <i>gutter</i>, from the water running down, Gen. xxx. 38; 2. <i>a curl</i>, from its flowing down (vide infra, vii. 6), and 3. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רָהִיט‎</span>, <i>a place upon which one runs</i>, <i>a charming spot much frequented</i>; just like <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שׁוּק‎</span>, <i>a place where people run</i>, <i>a street</i>, from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שׁוּק‎</span>, <i>to run</i>. It is now pretty generally agreed that <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בְּרוֹת‎</span>, the Aram. for <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בְּרוֹשׁ‎</span>, is not <i>the fir</i>, but <i>the cypress</i>. It is quite natural that this lofty tree, which grows to a height of from fifty
to sixty feet, of so hard and durable a nature, and so highly esteemed among the ancients,
(Virg. Georg. ii. 443,) should be placed together with the majestic cedar. Comp. Sirach,

<p><a href="#v2.1">1</a>. <i>I am a mere flower of the plain.</i> “As for me,” the Shulamite modestly insinuates, “my beauty is not peculiar, but is
of an ordinary character, like these flowers which are found in great profusion in
the plain and in the valley. The word <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חֲבַצֶלֶת‎</span>, which occurs only once more (Isa. xxxv. 1), is variously explained. The ancient
versions vary in their rendering of it. Thus the Sept. and Vulg. have here <span class="trans" title="anthos"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ἄνθος</span></span>, flos, <i>flower</i>; the Chald., <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נַרְקוֹם‎</span>, <i>narcissus</i>; so Saadias: whereas in Isa. the Sept., Vulg., Chald., render it <i>lily</i>. Modern critics are no less divided. Kimchi, Ibn Ezra, &amp;c., explain it <i>rose</i>; Michaelis, Ewald, Gesenius, Döpke, Henderson, Meier, &amp;c., take it to be <i>autumn crocus</i>, <i>colchicum autumnale</i>; De Wette, Rosenmüller, Royle, Winer, &amp;c., <i>narcissus</i>; Professor Lee, <i>lily</i>. The etymology of the word is likewise disputed. Some derive it from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בָּצַל‎</span>, <i>a bulb</i>, with <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ח‎</span> prefixed, as <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ח‎</span> like <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏א‎</span> is sometimes put before triliterals, in order to form a quadriliteral, (Gesenius,
Lehrg. p. 863, Rosenmüller, Henderson, Hengstenberg, &amp;c.,) and others take it as a
compound of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חָבַץ‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בָּצַל‎</span>, <i>acrid bulb</i>. (Ewald, Heiligstedt, &amp;c.) The most probable derivation, however, seems to be <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חָבַץ‎</span> = <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חָמַץ‎</span>, <i>to be bright</i>, <i>to shine</i>; hence <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חֲבַצֶל‎</span> (with the termination <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏–ֶל‎</span> like <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כַּרְמֶל‎</span>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עֲרָפֶל‎</span>), <i>a flower</i>; as most verbs which signify shining are used also to denote verdure and bloom. Compare
<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נִצָן‎</span>, <i>a flower</i>, from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נָצַץ‎</span>, <i>to shine</i>; and Simonis Arcanum <span class="corr" id="xd31e7731" title="Source: Forarum">Formarum</span>, p. 352. The word <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שָׁרוֹן‎</span> (for <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יְשָרֹוֹן‎</span>, like <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏סוֹר‎</span> for <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יְסוֹר‎</span>, from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יָשַׁר‎</span>, <i>to be straight</i>, <i>plain</i>, with the termination <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏–וֹן‎</span>, comp. Gesen. § 84, 15), is here best translated <i>a plain, or field</i>; so the Sept., Vulg., Percy, &amp;c. render <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חֲבַצֶלֶת הַשָּׁרוֹן‎</span>, <i>a flower of the field</i>; and this admirably suits the <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שׁוֹשַׁנַּת הָעֲמָקִים‎</span>, <i>lily of the valley</i>—a flower common in the valley.
</p>
<p><a href="#v2.2">2</a>. <i>As a lily among the thorns.</i> Beautifully and ingeniously does the shepherd take up this humble figure of the Shulamite,
and, by a happy turn, make it symbolical of her surpassing beauty. “It is true, that
thou art a lily, but as a lily surrounded by a multitude of brambles; so thou appearest
among all the damsels.” The expressions <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בֵּן‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בַּת‎</span> are not merely used for <i>son</i> and <i>daughter</i>, but also, idiomatically, denote <i>lad</i> and <i>lass</i>, <i>youth</i> and <i>damsel</i>. Gen. xxx. 13; Judg. xii. 9; Prov. vii. 7.
</p>
<p><a href="#v2.3">3</a>. <i>As an apple-tree</i>, &amp;c. The Shulamite returns the compliment: “As the charming apple-tree, covered with
beautifully tinged and sweetly smelling fruit, appears amidst the wild and barren
trees, so doest thou, my beloved, look among the youths. I delight,” continues the
Shulamite, “to repose beneath the shady tree, because of its charming fruit.” The
comparison between the delight which she had in the company of her beloved, and the
agreeable enjoyment which a shady tree affords, will especially be appreciated by
those who have travelled in the East, and had the opportunity of exchanging, in the
heat of the day, their close <span class="pageNum" id="pb142n">[<a href="#pb142n">142</a>]</span>tents for an airy and fragrant bower. Comp. Gen. xviii. 4, 8; 1 Sam. xxii. 6; Rosenm.
Morgenl. i. 49; iii. 528. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תַּפוּחַ‎</span> is taken by the Chald. for <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אָתְרוּנָא‎</span>, <i>citron</i>; by Rosenmüller and others, for <i>quince</i>. The expression occurs only six times in the Scriptures; four times in this book
(besides the present instance, see also ii. 5; vii. 9; viii. 5); once in Prov. xxv.
11; and once in Joel i. 12. It is used in three passages out of the six for the tree
itself, and in the other three for its fruit. But in all these places the common apple-tree
or apple is quite in keeping with the context, and the etymology of the word, viz.,
<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נָפַח‎</span>, <i>to breathe</i>, <i>to breathe sweetly</i>; hence <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תַּפּוּחַ‎</span>, from its fragrant breath, is an appropriate description of the common apple in Syria
(Ovid. Met. viii. 675), and, indeed, in all other countries. It is evident from proper
names (Josh. xii. 17; xvi. 8), that this tree was much cultivated in Palestine at
a very early period. In the Talmud we frequently meet <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תַּפוּחַ‎</span>, used to denote the common apple. It is worthy of notice that the shepherd calls
his beloved <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שׁוֹשָׁנָה‎</span>, <i>fem.</i>, whilst she calls him <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תַּפּוּחַ‎</span>, <i>mas</i>. The second verb <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏וְיָשַׁבְתִּי‎</span> is subordinated to the <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חִמַּדְתִּי‎</span>, by means of the <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ו‎</span> and the two words are well rendered by the Chald. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רְגִינַת לְמֵיתַב‎</span>, <i>I delight to sit</i>; comp. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֵיכָכָה אוּכָל וְרָאִיתִי‎</span>, <i>how shall I endure and witness</i>, for <i>how shall I endure to witness</i>, Esth. viii. 6. This subordination also occurs without the <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ו‎</span>; comp. infra, vii. 8; viii. 2; Job x. 16; xix. 3; Gesen. § 142<span class="corr" id="xd31e7864" title="Source: .">,</span> 3 a, b; Ewald, § 285.
</p>
<p><a href="#v2.4">4</a>. <i>He led me</i>, &amp;c. Having represented her beloved, in the preceding verse, as a tree, forming with
its widely-spread branches and rich foliage a shady bower, in which she delighted
to repose and enjoy its delicious fruit, the Shulamite here narrates, in the same
metaphorical language, how he took her into that bower of delight, that arbour of
love. The words <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בֵּית הַיָּיִן‎</span> mean <i>bower of delight</i>, wine being frequently used in this book for delight; and are but a designation of
the manifestations of love denoted in the preceding verse by <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תַּפוּחַ‎</span>, <i>delicious apple-tree</i>. So also the word <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דֶגֶל‎</span>, from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דָּגַל‎</span>, <i>to cover</i>, retaining here its primary meaning, <i>cover</i>, <i>shade</i>, corresponds to <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צֵל‎</span>, <i>shade</i>, in the last verse. The Sept., Sym., Syriac, Arab., which are followed by many moderns,
read <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הֲבִיאֻנִי‎</span>, and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דִגְלוּ‎</span>, <i>bring me</i>, and <i>cover me</i>, imper., arising most likely from a wish to produce uniformity in this and the following
verses.
</p>
<p><a href="#v2.5">5</a>. <i>Oh, strengthen me</i>, &amp;c. The rehearsal of their past union and enjoyment kindled the Shulamite’s affections,
and made her wish again for that delicious fruit, <i>i.e.</i> the tokens of his love. The cakes here mentioned were held in high estimation in
the East; here, however, both the cakes and the apples are to be taken figuratively
as expressions of love. This is obvious from the preceding verse, and from the words,
“for I am sick with love,” for no real cake or apple could cure a heart suffering
from this complaint. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֲשִׁישָׁה‎</span> (from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אָשָׁשׁ‎</span>, <i>to burn</i>, <i>to fire</i>; hence <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֵשׁ‎</span>, <i>fire</i>, like <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֵם‎</span>, <i>mother</i>, from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אָמַם‎</span>, <i>to join</i>, <i>to unite</i>), <i>something made by fire</i>, <i>a sort of sweet cake</i> prepared with fire, and is most probably the same which in Hos. iii. 1 is written
more fully <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֲשִׁישֵׁי עֲנַבִים‎</span>, <i>grape-cakes</i>. The meaning, <i>cake</i>, is retained in the Sept. in all the passages (except Isa. xvi. 7, where the Sept.
reads <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֲנְשֵׁי‎</span>, instead of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֲשִׁישֵׁי‎</span>, see the parallel place, Jer. xlviii. 31), where this word occurs. Thus <span class="trans" title="laganon apo tēganou"><span lang="grc" class="grek">λάγανον ἀπὸ τηγάνου</span></span>, <i>a cake</i> from the frying-pan, 2 Sam. vi. 19; and in <span class="pageNum" id="pb143n">[<a href="#pb143n">143</a>]</span>the parallel passage, 1 Chron. xvi. 3, <span class="trans" title="amoritēs"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ἀμορίτης</span></span>, a sweet <i>cake</i>; in Hos. iii. 1, <span class="trans" title="pemma"><span lang="grc" class="grek">πέμμα</span></span>, a <i>baked cake</i>; and <span class="trans" title="amorais"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ἀμόραις</span></span>, <i>sweet cakes</i>, in the passage before us. This meaning is supported by the Chald. on Exod. xvi.
31, where <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֲשִׁישְׁיָן‎</span> is used for the Hebrew <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏<span class="corr" id="xd31e8016" title="Source: צַפִּיהִית">צַפִּיחִית</span>‎</span>, and Mishna Nedarim, vi. 10. Gesenius, Hitzig, Henderson, Fürst, &amp;c., derive it from
<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אָשַׁשׁ‎</span>, <i>to press</i>, <i>to compress</i>, whence, they say, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֲשִׁישָׁה‎</span>, <i>a cake</i> made of dried grapes <i>pressed</i> together, and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֲשִׁישׁ‎</span>, <i>a foundation</i> (Isa. xvi. 7), which is <i>pressed</i> down by treading on it. But as the transition from cake to foundation is not so easily
conceived, and especially as the meaning <i>to press</i>, attached to <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אָשׁשׁ‎</span>, is nowhere to be found in Hebrew (the word in Isa. xvi. 7 is to be translated <i>cake</i>, see Hengstenberg, Christ. i. p. 315), it is far better to derive this word as above
from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אָשַׁשׁ‎</span>, <i>to burn</i>. The Rabbinical explanation, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נִרְבָא דְחַמְרָא‎</span>, <i>flagons of wine</i>, which the Authorized Version follows, is not borne out by the etymology, nor does
it suit the passages in which this word occurs, and is therefore rightly abandoned
by modern lexicographers. The rendering of Hodgson, “Support me with cups, around
me strew apples;” and that of Michaelis, “Support me with verdant herbs, spread fragrant
fruits under me,” are contrary to the meaning of the words.
</p>
<p><a href="#v2.6">6</a>. <i>Let his right hand</i>, &amp;c. The pressure of the attempts to alienate her affections from him whom her soul
loveth, and the burning desire to be re-united with him, though well sustained by
her noble mind, yet overcame her body; and whilst momentarily sinking beneath the
weight, the Shulamite desires that no other hand should raise her drooping head, no
other arm support her exhausted frame than that of her beloved. This verse is to be
taken in the optative mood. Comp. Ps. vii. 9; xlv. 2; Ewald, § 329 a.
</p>
<p><a href="#v2.7">7</a>. <i>I adjure you</i>, &amp;c. Having evinced her warm and undiminished attachment to her beloved shepherd,
the Shulamite adjures the court ladies, who, as we have seen, tried to gain her affections
for the king, by everything dear and lovely, not to excite her love for anyone else
till her own (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אהבה‎</span>) <i>affections</i> wish (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דוד אחר‎</span>) <i>for another object</i>. The gazelle, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צְבִי‎</span>, so called from the beauty of its form, is an animal of the antelope kind, of very
graceful and elegant figure, has very slender limbs, large and soft eyes. The great
admiration in which this animal was held in the East, made the Hebrews use it as an
emblem of everything beautiful (Prov. v. 19); and from its being charming and lovely,
it also became an object by which to swear. Such adjurations are frequently used in
the East. Comp. Reland, de Religio Mah. ii. p. 164: Rosenmüller, Orient. i. 146; v.
22. Dio, in the Æneid, lib. iv. 314; Bochart, Hieroz. i. p. 899. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֶתְכֶם‎</span>, <i>mas<span class="corr" id="xd31e8092" title="Not in source">.</span></i>, for <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֶתְכֶן‎</span>, <i>fem.</i> Both masculine pronouns and verbs are sometimes used in reference to objects which
are feminine. See Gesenius, § 121, Rem. i. § 137, 1; Ewald, § 184 c. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אִם‎</span>, after formulæ of swearing, has the effect of a negative particle (Isa. xxii. 14;
Prov. xxvii. 14). This is owing to a part of the oath being omitted. Comp. 2 Sam.
iii. 35; Gesen. § 155, 2 f.; Ewald, § 356 a. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עוּר‎</span>, here, is not <i>to arouse</i>, <i>to wake from sleep</i> (Gesen.), but <i>to rouse</i>, <i>to excite the passions</i>, <i>affections</i>; thus <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הֵעִיר קַנְאָה‎</span>, <i>he will arouse his zeal</i>, Isa. xlii. 13; Prov. x. 12. The repetition of the same verb in the Hiphil and Piel
expresses <i>intensity</i>, <span class="pageNum" id="pb144n">[<a href="#pb144n">144</a>]</span>Isa. xxix. 9; Zeph. ii. 1. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אַהֲבָה‎</span> is the abstract, <i>love</i>, <i>affection</i>, iii. 10; vii. 7. After <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שֶׁתֶּחְפָּץ‎</span> supply <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דוֹד אֲחַר‎</span>. Similarly, Rashbam. The Sept. strangely renders <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בִּצְבָאוֹת אוֹ בְּאַילוֹת הַשָּׂדֶה‎</span>, <span class="trans" title="en dynamesi kai ischysesi tou agrou"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ἐν δυνάμεσι καὶ ἰσχύσεσι τοῦ ἀγροῦ</span></span>, <i>by the powers and virtues of the field</i>. Thus in this scene, the first attempts, both on the part of the king and the court
ladies, to win the Shulamite’s affections, signally failed. The same formula re-occurs
iii. 5, and viii. 4, to mark, at the end of the trials, her successful resistance.
</p>
<p><a href="#v2.8">8</a>. <i>Hark! my beloved!</i> Having alluded in the preceding Section (i. 6) to the ill-treatment which she had
received from her brothers, the Shulamite now relates the cause of that treatment.
Thus whilst this narrative forms the connecting link between this and the preceding
Section, it also gradually acquaints us with her history. The description given of
the arrival and conduct of her beloved is very graphic and beautiful. She first sees
him at a distance, bounding over the hills with the speed of the swift-footed gazelle,
and presently he is found behind the wall, peeping through the window, and imploring
her in the sweetest language imaginable to go with him into the fields and enjoy the
beauties and charms of nature. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קוֹל‎</span> is not <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קוֹל רַגְלָיו‎</span>, <i>the sound of his feet</i> (Ibn Ezra, Hitzig), which could not be heard at such a distance from the mountains;
nor <i>the voice of his song</i> (Döpke, Philippson), for he could not very well sing when running at such a speed
as here described; but simply means <i>hark!</i> (Ewald, Magnus, Meier), <span class="pageNum" id="pb145n">[<a href="#pb145n">145</a>]</span>and is used in animated descriptions to arrest attention, Ewald, § 286 f.
</p>
<p>9 <i>My beloved is like</i>, &amp;c. To describe the speed of his approach the Shulamite compares him to the swift-footed
gazelle, and nimble fawn. This comparison is also used in other parts of Scripture.
Thus Asahel is called light-footed as a gazelle. 2 Sam. ii. 18; Prov. vi. 5; Hab.
iii. 19. “The Eastern buildings generally surround a square inner court; the beloved
is described as gradually making his approach, first to the wall, then looking through
the window.” Here is another incontestable proof that the object of the damsel’s affection,
whom she describes as coming to her, is not the king, but a shepherd, for the king
could not consistently be represented as bounding over the hills. Though <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אַיָּל‎</span> has a feminine, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אַיָּלָה‎</span>, which is used in ver. 7, yet instead of its being here <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לְעֹפֶר אֲיָלוֹת‎</span>, we have <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הָאַיָּלִים‎</span>: see also Ps. xlii. 2. This is owing to the neglect on the part of the writer to
avail himself of the forms established by usage, Gesen. § 107, 1. Or it may be that
such names were still of a common gender, and the feminines were only in the process
of formation, but not as yet fixedly established, Ewald, § 175 b. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כֹּתֶל‎</span> occurs only here, but it is evident from Dan. v. 5, and the Targum, Josh. ii. 15,
where it stands for the Hebrew <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קִיר‎</span>, that it means <i>a wall</i> forming a part of the house. The Sept. has here <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עַל הָרֵי בָתָר‎</span>, from ii. 17.
</p>
<p>10, 11. <i>Arise, my love</i>, &amp;c. The Shulamite introduces here her beloved as speaking. He urges her to go, since
the rain is over, and everything without is charming. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עָנָה‎</span> is idiomatically used in reference even to the person speaking first, without any
antecedent interrogation. (Deut. xxvi. 5; Isa. xiv. 10; xxi. 9.) The meaning of the
word seems to be simply <i>to impart information</i>, either asked for or not. In the former case <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עָנָה‎</span> obtains the additional idea of <i>a reply</i>, whereas in the latter it merely means <i>to inform</i>, <i>to tell</i>, like <span class="trans" title="apokrinomai"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ἀποκρίνομαι</span></span> in the New Testament. Comp. <span class="trans" title="apokritheis eipe"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ἀποκριθεῖς εἶπε</span></span>, Matt. xvii. 4; Mark ix. 5. On the use of the dative <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לָךְ‎</span>, see Gesen. § 154, 3 e. Ewald, § 315 a. The <span class="trans" title="hapa. leg."><span lang="grc" class="grek"><abbr title="ἅπαξ λεγόμενον"><span class="corr" id="xd31e8246" title="Source: ἁπα.">ἅπα.</span> λέγ.</abbr></span></span> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏סְתָו‎</span> properly denotes <i>the winter</i> = <i>the rainy season</i>, at the end of which, viz. February or March, the spring advances with surpassing
quickness; it excludes the autumn, and thus differs from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חֹרֶף‎</span>. The form <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏סְתָו‎</span> (from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏סָתָה‎</span>, <i>to winter</i>), is, according to the analogy of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חֲגָו‎</span>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מְדָו‎</span>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קְצָו‎</span>, see Fürst, Lexicon, under <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חֲגָו‎</span>. The Sept. has mistaken the dative <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לָךְ‎</span> for the imp. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לְכִי‎</span>, and adds <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יוֹנָתִי‎</span>, <i>my dove</i>, after <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יָפָתִי‎</span>, <i>my beauty</i>.
</p>
<p><a href="#v2.12">12</a>. <i>The flowers appear</i>, &amp;c. The gradual development is exceedingly beautiful; the description unfolds with
the season. After the graphic delineation of the meadows strewed with a profusion
of variegated flowers; of the men in the fields, and the birds hovering over them,
joining to pour forth a volume of various sounds; of the delicious odour of the embalmed
fig, and fragrant vine, the beloved <span class="pageNum" id="pb146n">[<a href="#pb146n">146</a>]</span>exclaims: “Nature has prepared a rich banquet; come, let us go and enjoy it!” The
Sept., Aquila, Sym., Vulg., Chald., Rashbam, render <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עֵת הַוָּמִיר‎</span>, by <i>the season for the pruning of vines</i>: Gesenius defends this rendering, but against the usage of the word <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏זָמִיר‎</span>, and the connexion. Wherever <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏זָמִיר‎</span> occurs, either in the singular (Isa. xxv. 5), or plural (2 Sam. xxiii. 1; Isa. xxiv.
16), it invariably means <i>song</i> or <i>singing</i>. Moreover, the parallelism, and the whole of the description, demand that it should
be rendered so here. All the pleasures and charms here depicted are gratifications
for the senses, and are adduced by the beloved as the invitation of nature to <i>enjoy</i> her banquet; whereas the pruning of the vines would be a summons to <i>engage in toil</i>. Besides, the vine is mentioned afterwards in its rotation (v. 13), and it would
mar the gradual progression of this minute description to suppose that it has been
uselessly repeated. Hence it has been rightly rendered <i>singing</i> by Rashi, Kimchi, Ibn Ezra, Anonymous Oxford Manuscript, Mendelssohn, Kleuker, Ewald,
Döpke, Rosenmüller, De Wette, Magnus, Hengstenberg, Philippson, Fürst, Meier, Hitzig,
&amp;c. The objection that <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏זָמִיר‎</span>, <i>singing</i>, means the <i>song of men</i>, is obviated by referring it here to the season when <i>both</i> man and bird begin to sing. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏זָמִיר‎</span>, like other words of the form <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קָטִיל‎</span>, expresses the <i>time</i> of the action; comp. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אָסִיף‎</span>, <i>harvest</i>; properly the time when the fruit is gathered. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חָרִישׁ‎</span>, <i>the time of ploughing</i>. Gesen. § 84, 5; Ewald, § 149 e.
</p>
<p><i>The cooing of the turtle</i>, &amp;c. The turtle-dove is a migratory bird (Jer. viii. 7; Arist. Hist. Anim. viii.
3, 12, 16; Pliny, Hist. Nat. x. 36; Winer, Bib. Dict.; Kitto, Cyclop. Bib. Lit. s.v.);
it resides in the winter farther south than Palestine, and returns in the spring,
when its cooing voice in the woods announces the return of that season.
</p>
<p><a href="#v2.13">13</a>. <i>The fig-tree sweetens her green figs.</i> The word <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חָנַט‎</span> is now rendered by many commentators, according to the example of Ibn Ezra, <i>to sweeten</i>, <i>to embalm</i>, <i>to spice</i>; <i>i.e.</i> the fig-tree sweetens her fruit by filling it with aromatic juice. This rendering
is confirmed by the use of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חָנַט‎</span>, <i>to embalm</i> (Gen. l. 2, 26), which was done with spices and aromatic plants (2 Chron. xvi. 14;
John xix. 40). The Sept., Aquila., and Vulg. render <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חָנַט‎</span>, <i>puts forth</i>, but this signification cannot be deduced from the root. Ewald, Magnus, Hitzig, have
“the fig-tree <i>reddens</i>,” &amp;c., but the verb is not used in this sense in Hebrew. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פָּג‎</span> (from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פָּגַג‎</span> <i>immature</i>), <i>an unripe fig</i>, Sept. <span class="trans" title="olynthos"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ὄλυνθος</span></span>, Vulg. <i lang="la">grossus</i>; so in the Talmud and Ibn <span class="corr" id="xd31e8425" title="Source: Erza">Ezra</span>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פרי טרם שיתבשל‎</span>, <i>the fruit before it is ripe</i>.
</p>
<p><i>The vines blossom</i>, &amp;c. It is well known that the blossoming vine smells sweetly; comp. Pliny, Hist.
Nat. xiv. 2. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏וְהַנְּפָנִים סְמָדַר‎</span>, lit. <i>the vines are in blossom</i>, i.e. <i>the vines blossom</i>; so Sym. <span class="trans" title="oinanthē"><span lang="grc" class="grek">οἰνάνθη</span></span>, Vulg. <i lang="la">florentes</i>. Substantives are frequently used in Hebrew instead of adjectives to express properties;
thus <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏וְהַפִּשְׁתָּה גִבְעֹל‎</span>, <i>the flax was bolled</i>. Exod. ix. 31; Ezra. x. 13. This peculiarity is to be accounted for by supposing
either that the adjectives were not as yet formed, or if formed were still not currently
used. Gesen. § 106, 1; Ewald, § 296 b. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לָכְי‎</span> stands for <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לָךְ‎</span>; comp. ver. 10; the <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏י‎</span> has been occasioned by the preceding form <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קוּמִי‎</span>, and succeeding words <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רַעֳיתִי יָפָהִי‎</span>, which terminate in <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏י‎</span>. This is not unfrequently <span class="pageNum" id="pb147n">[<a href="#pb147n">147</a>]</span>the case, see Job xix. 29; Eccl. viii. 17; Prov. viii. 35; Mich. i. 8. The Sept. has
here again <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לְכִי‎</span> for <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לָךָ‎</span>, and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יֹונָתִי‎</span> after <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יָפָיָתִי‎</span>.
</p>
<p><a href="#v2.14">14</a>. <i>My dove in the clefts</i>, &amp;c. Having described the charming aspect of nature, he repeated his invitation to
her to go with him into the fields. Impatient at her apparent delay, the beloved,
whilst calling her by the endearing epithet “dove,” delicately ascribed to her the
timorous character of that bird. Doves in the East make their nests in the clefts
of elevated rocks and cliffs (Jer. xxviii. 28), which they are exceedingly afraid
to leave when once frightened. Thus Homer, Iliad, xxi. 493:

But the <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏י‎</span> here may be retained, and the word may still be singular. For many nouns from roots
<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ל״ה‎</span> preserve in the singular before a suffix the original <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏י‎</span> of the root, and thus have the appearance of the plural: <i>e.g.</i> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מִקְנֶיךָ‎</span>, <i>thy castle</i> (Isa. xxx. 23), from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מִקְנֶה‎</span>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מַרְאָיו‎</span>, the same expression, Job xli. 1; Gesen. § 93, 9; Ewald, § 256 b.

<p><a href="#v2.15">15</a>. <i>Catch us the foxes</i>, &amp;c. The Shulamite here quotes the words of her brothers, who had overheard the invitation.
To prevent the meeting of the lovers, the brothers gave the damsel employment in the
vineyard, to catch and keep out the foxes. To this she refers in i. 6, when, repelling
the disdainful looks of the court ladies, and accounting for her brown complexion,
she mentions the severe treatment of her brothers. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שׁוּעָלִים‎</span>, <i>foxes</i>, as well as jackals, were very numerous in Palestine (Judg. xv. 4; Lam. v. 18; Ps.
lxiii. 11; Neh. iv. 3). There was a district actually called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֶרֶץ שׁוּעָל‎</span>, from the abundance of these creatures, 1 Sam. xiii. 17. These animals are gregarious,
found in packs of two or three hundred (Boch. Hieroz. lib. iii. 12), and are described,
both by sacred and profane writers, as destructive to vineyards, Sam. i. 17, 18; and
Theocritus, Idyl. v. 112:

<p class="first">also Idyl. i. 47–50. The young foxes are especially injurious to the vineyards, because
they burrow in holes in the ground, Neh. iv. 3. The brothers, in the last clause,
assign a reason for their proposal; the <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ו‎</span> in <span class="pageNum" id="pb148n">[<a href="#pb148n">148</a>]</span><span lang="he" class="hebr">‏וּכְרָמֵינוּ‎</span> is therefore to be rendered <i>for</i>, Gesen. § 155, 1 c. The Sept. inadvertently omits the word <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שׁוּעָלִים‎</span>.
</p>
<p><a href="#v2.16">16</a>. <i>My beloved is mine</i>, &amp;c. The Shulamite tells the court ladies how she had consoled herself under these
circumstances of separation: “Though my brothers succeeded in separating us bodily
by assigning to me this post of keeping the vineyards, yet our affections are inseparable;
and though still separated from me, my beloved is mine and I am his; his who tends
his flock in the meadows abounding with flowers.” It seems as if the words, “he who
feeds his flock among the lilies,” were designedly added, whenever the damsel speaks
of her beloved, to show unmistakably that he was a shepherd. How such passages can
be reconciled with the supposition that the king is the object of the maiden’s attachment,
or, according to others, that the maiden is the daughter of Pharaoh, is difficult
to divine.
</p>
<p><a href="#v2.17">17</a>. <i>When the day cools</i>, &amp;c. She also relates how she had comforted her beloved, telling him that this state
of separation would not last long; that he must come in the evening, when unobserved,
with the same swift-footed speed as he came in the morning. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עַד שָׁיָפוּחַ הַיּוֹם‎</span>, <i>i.q.</i> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עַד שֶׁיָפוּחַ רוּחַ הַיּוֹם‎</span>, <i>when the day breeze blows</i>, <i>i.e.</i> in the evening, shortly before sunset, when a gentle and cooling breeze blows in
the East (see Pliny, Hist. Nat. ii. 47); hence <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רוּחַ הַיּוֹם‎</span>, Gen. iii. 8, opposed to <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חוֹם הַיּוֹם‎</span>, xviii. 1. That this is the sense of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שֶׁיָפוּחַ הַיּוֹם‎</span>, and not <i>day-break</i> (English Ver.), or <i>morning-breath</i> (Good), is evident from the immediately following <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏וְנָסוּ הַצְלָלִים‎</span>, which expresses the same idea in other words, <i>i.q.</i> <i>evening</i>; comp. Job xiv. 2. The shadows are said to flee away when at sunset they become elongated
and stretched out; thus as it were run away from us, further and further, till they
eventually vanish in the dark of night. Hence David, speaking of the approaching sunset
of his life, says, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יָמַֹי כְּצֵל נָטוּי‎</span>, <i>My days are like an elongated shadow</i>, Ps. cii. 12; cix. 23. Comp. also Virg. Eclog. i. 84, and ii. 66. So Herder, Kleuker,
Ewald, Gesen., Döpke, Rosenmüller, Magnus, Heiligstedt, Fürst, Philippson, Meier,
Hengstenberg, Hitzig. The rendering of Hodgson, Good, &amp;c., “<i>till the day-breath</i>,” and their reference to the passage of Milton, “Sweet is the breath of morn” (Par.
Lost, iv. 641), is gratuitous. The words <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הֶרֵי בָתֶר‎</span> are rendered by the Sept. <span class="trans" title="orē tōn koilōmatōn"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ὄρη τῶν κοιλωμάτων</span></span>, <i>mountains of cavities</i>, <i>i.e.</i> decussated mountains, from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בָּתַר‎</span>, <i>to divide</i>, <i>to cut</i>, which Gesenius and Heiligstedt explain, <i>a region divided by mountains and valleys</i>, but very unsatisfactorily. The Syriac and Theodo. have <span class="trans" title="thymiamatōn"><span lang="grc" class="grek">θυμιαμάτων</span></span>, taking <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בָּתֶר‎</span> for <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בְּשָׂמִים‎</span>, which is adopted by Meier; but this emendation is unsupported by MSS., and has evidently
arisen from viii. 14. The Vulg. and Rashbam take <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בָּתֶר‎</span> as a proper name, <i lang="la">montes Bether</i>; but neither place nor mountain is known by such name. The Chald., Ibn Ezra, Rashi
explain <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הָרֵי בָתֶר‎</span> by <i>mountains of separation</i>, <i>i.e.</i> mountains which separate thee from me: this is followed by Luther, Ewald, De Wette,
Hengstenberg, Philippson, Hitzig, and is most <span class="pageNum" id="pb149n">[<a href="#pb149n">149</a>]</span>consonant with the context. We have seen (ver. 9), that there were mountains separating
the houses of the lovers, which the shepherd had to cross to reach the Shulamite;
and as she told him to go back and return in the evening, it was evident that he had
to cross again those separating mountains.
</p>
<p><a href="#v3.1">1</a>. <i>When on my nightly couch</i>, &amp;c. Through some means or other her beloved did not come in the evening according
to request, and, unable to wait any longer, she retired. Her thoughts, however, kept
her awake, and her confidence in him made her look for him even when on her couch.
The words <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עַל מִשְׁכָּבִי וְגו״‎</span> do not mean, “I sought him <i>in my bed</i>,” at which unnecessary umbrage has been taken, but “Even when I reclined upon my
nocturnal couch, I could not give him up; I still sought to find him.” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מִשְׁכָּבִי בַּלֵילוֹת‎</span> means <i>my couch used at nights</i>, <i>i.q.</i> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מִשְׁכַּב הַלֵּילוֹת‎</span>, in contradistinction to <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מִשְׁכַּב הַצָהֳרַיִם‎</span>, <i>a couch used at noonday</i>, 2 Sam. iv. 5. This is evident from the plural <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בַּלֵילוֹת‎</span>, <i>in the nights</i>, and from ver. 8, where the same plural is used to describe nocturnal marauders.
The affirmation of Harmer, therefore, that no reasonable doubt can be made that these
are the words of one to whose bed the beloved was no stranger, falls to the ground.
The Sept. adds, <span class="trans" title="ekalesa auton kai ouch hypēkousen eme"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ἐκάλεσα αὐτὸν καὶ οὐχ ὑπηκούσεν ἐμὲ</span></span>, from chap. v. 6.
</p>
<p><a href="#v3.2">2</a>. <i>I must arise now</i>, &amp;c. Seeing, however, that her beloved did not come, and apprehending that some disaster
might have befallen him on his way, the Shulamite determined to go and find him. The
<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏–ָה‎</span> in <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֲקוּמָה‎</span> is expressive of self-summons and determination: “I said to myself, Come! I must
arise now!” Comp. Ps. ii. 3; lv. 3; Gesen. § 128, 1; Ewald, § 228 a.
</p>
<p><a href="#v3.3">3</a>. <i>The watchmen</i>, &amp;c., found her whilst engaged in seeking her beloved, and she at once inquired of
them whether they had seen him. The interrogative particle is here omitted. This is
sometimes the case when the whole sentence, as here, is interrogative, in which case
it is distinguished by the prominence given to the word upon which the force or weight
of the interrogation more especially falls; as by the tone in which it is uttered,
<i>e.g.</i> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏זֶה חַסְדְּךָ אֶת־רֵעֶךָ‎</span>, “<i>This</i> thy kindness to thy friend!” 2 Sam. xvi. 17; xviii. 29; Gesen. § 153, 1; Ewald, §
324 a.
</p>
<p><a href="#v3.4">4</a>. <i>Scarcely had I passed them</i>, &amp;c. The abruptness of the description here is very characteristic. She informs us
that she had put a question to the watchmen, but, in her hurry to find her beloved,
does not tell us the answer which she received. The construction <span class="pageNum" id="pb150n">[<a href="#pb150n">150</a>]</span><span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כִּמְעַט שֶׁ—עַד‎</span>, <i>scarcely when</i>, is nowhere else to be found in the Old Testament; it may be resolved to <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏זמן אשר עברתי מהם כמעט‎</span>, <i>the time that I passed them amounted to a little while</i>.
</p>
<p><a href="#v3.5">5</a>. <i>I adjure you</i>, &amp;c. Having expressed her deep attachment to her beloved shepherd, she again adjures
the court ladies not to persuade her to love any one else. Comp. ii. 7. The Sept.
has again <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צְבָאוֹת‎</span>, <i>powers</i>, and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֵילוֹת‎</span>, <i>virtues</i>; <span lang="la">vide supra</span>, ii. 7.
</p>
<p><a href="#v3.6">6</a>. <i>What is that, &amp;c.</i> The situation changes. The state tents have been broken up in the neighbourhood of
the Shulamite’s home, and the royal train travels towards Jerusalem. Some of the inhabitants,
as they see at a distance the procession almost enveloped in the fragrant cloud of
smoke arising from the incense profusely burned, exclaim, “What is that coming up
from the country?” “The burning of perfumes in the East, in the preceding part of
processions, is both very ancient and very general. Deities (images) were probably
the first honoured with this ceremony, and afterwards their supposed vicegerents,
human divinities. We have a relic of the same custom still existing among ourselves,
in the flowers strewed or borne in public processions, at coronations, &amp;c., and before
our great officers of state: as the Lord Chancellor, the Speaker of the House of Commons;
and in <span class="pageNum" id="pb151n">[<a href="#pb151n">151</a>]</span>some corporations, <i>the mace</i>, as an ensign of office, has the same origin, though now reduced to a gilded ornament
only.” See Calmet, Dictionary, and Rosenmüller, Orient. iv. 948. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מִי‎</span> is properly used of <i>persons</i>, but also of <i>things</i>, especially when the notion of person or persons is in them, <i>e.g.</i> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מִי לְךָ כָּל הַמַּחְנֶה הַזֶּה‎</span>, “<i>What is all this company with thee?</i><span class="corr" id="xd31e8915" title="Not in source">”</span> Gen. xxxiii. 8; Mich. i. 5. That this is here the meaning of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מִי‎</span>, is evident from the answer, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הִנֵּה מִטָּתוֹ‎</span>, <i>Behold, it is the palanquin</i>. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מִדְבָּר‎</span> (from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דָבַר‎</span>, <i>to range in order</i>, <i>to guide</i>, <i>to drive flocks</i>), here is not <i>desert</i>, but, as frequently, <i>an uninhabited plain</i> or <i>country</i>, where flocks are tended, in contradistinction to town, where people dwell. Comp.
Isa. xlii. 11; Jer. xxiii. 10; Joel ii. 22. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תִּימְרוֹת‎</span>, the plur. of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תִּמָרָה‎</span>, like <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צִדְקוֹת‎</span>, from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צְדָקָה‎</span>, <i>columns</i> or <i>clouds</i>, only occurs once more, Joel iii. 3, and is most probably derived from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תָּמַר‎</span>, <i>to ascend</i>, to rise up like a column or cloud. The <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏י‎</span> has merely been inserted to help the pronunciation (comp. Exod. xxv. 31; Ps. xix.
4.), and, indeed, nineteen MSS. and originally another omit the <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏י‎</span>, which is undoubtedly the correct reading. The <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כּ‎</span> in <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כְּתִּימְרוֹת‎</span> signifies <i>as in</i>. Comp. Isa. v. 17; xxix. 7; Gesen. Gram. § 118, 3, Rem. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כֹּל‎</span> is used for a plurality comprising, or consisting of, <i>divers single things</i> or <i>objects</i>, and is to be rendered <i>all kinds</i>.

used by the Jews (Exod. xxx. 34; Lev. ii. 1, 2; Isa. lxiii. 23) and other nations
(Tibull. Lib. Eleg. ii.; Ovid. Trist. Lib. V. Eleg. v. 11) in sacrifices for fumigation.
It is represented as a shrub, growing on mountains, and thorny, both in Arabia (Isa.
lx. 6; Jer. vi. 20) and in Palestine, according to the passage here; reaches a height
of about five feet, and resembles in its leaves and fruit the myrtle. The frankincense
is obtained by incisions which are made twice a year; the first in the beginning of
autumn, which is white and pure (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לְבֹנָה זָכָּה‎</span>, Exod. xxx. 34), and is regarded as superior; and the second incision is made in
the winter, when the resin thus obtained is reddish, and considered much inferior.

real analogy in the Scriptures; it frequently occurs in latter Hebrew writings. Comp.
<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תהתיתו של ההר‎</span>, <i>the bottom of the mountain</i>, in Rashbam on the Song of Songs, iv. 1. The <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גִבּרִֹים‎</span> here mentioned, were a separate class of the body-guard formed by David; and, as
co-religionists (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גִבֹּרֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל‎</span>), seem to have been chosen to protect the monarch on his excursion against any attack
of nocturnal marauders, so frequent and so much dreaded in the East. Comp. Job i.
15, with Gen. xvi. 12. The <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מ‎</span> in <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מִגִּבֹּרֵי‎</span> is used <i>partitively</i>, <span lang="la">vide supra</span>, i. 2. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֲחוּזֵי חֶרֶב‎</span>, <i>skilled in the sword</i>. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אָחַז‎</span>, <i>to take hold</i>, also <i>to handle artfully</i>, like <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תָּפַשׂ‎</span>, <i>to take hold</i>, <i>to handle skilfully</i>.

verb. Comp. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בּטוּחַ בַּיהוָֹה‎</span>, <i>he trusted in Jehovah</i>, Ps. cxii. 7; Gesen. <span class="corr" id="xd31e9099" title="Not in source">§ </span>50, 3, Rem. 2; Ewald, § 149 d. This removes the apparent contradiction caused by the
Authorized Version, “They all hold swords;” when in the next clause, as Hodgson and
Good remarked, we are told that each had his sword on <i>his thigh</i>. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אִישׁ‎</span>, <i>a man</i> is used as <i>a distributive</i> for <i>each</i>, <i>every</i>. Comp. Gen. xv. 18; xlii. 25; Gesen. § 124, 2, Rem. 1; Ewald, § 278, b. We must supply

</p>
<p><a href="#v3.9">9</a>. <i>A palanquin</i>, &amp;c. As the train draws nearer, a third person recognizes it as the newly-made palanquin,
of which he gives a circumstantial description. Palanquins were and are still used
in the East by great personages. They are like a couch, sufficiently long for the
rider to recline, covered with a canopy resting on pillars at the four corners, hung
round with curtains to exclude the sun; they have a door, sometimes of lattice-work,
on each side. They are borne by four or more men, by means of strong poles, like those
of our sedan-chairs; and in travelling great distances, there are always several sets
of men to relieve each other. The materials of which these palanquins are made, and
the style of their construction, depend upon the rank and wealth of the owners. The
word <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אַפִּרְיֹון‎</span> is most probably derived from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פָּרָה‎</span>, <i>to run</i>, <i>to be borne quickly</i>. Comp. <span class="trans" title="trochos"><span lang="grc" class="grek">τρόχος</span></span>, from <span class="trans" title="trechein"><span lang="grc" class="grek">τρέχειν</span></span>, <span class="trans" title="phoreion"><span lang="grc" class="grek">φορεῖον</span></span>, from <span class="trans" title="pherō"><span lang="grc" class="grek">φέρω</span></span>, <i lang="la">currus</i> from <i lang="la">currendo</i>, <i lang="la">ferculum</i> from <i lang="la">fero</i>. The form <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אַפִּרְיּוֹן‎</span> is, according to the analogy of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דִּמְיוֹן‎</span>, <i>likeness</i> (Ps. xvii. 12), and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פִּדְיֹון‎</span>, <i>ransom</i> (Exod. xxi. 30); comp. Gesen. § 84, 15; Ewald, § 163 c. with a prosthetic <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏א‎</span> (Gesen. § 19, 4; Ewald, § 162 c,) followed by <i>a Dagesh forte</i> like <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אַפֶּדֶן‎</span>, <i>a palace</i>, Dan. xi. 45; see Fürst, Lexicon. Ewald, however, derives it from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פרה‎</span> = <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ברה‎</span>, <i>to work out</i>, <i>to build</i>, <i>to form</i>, hence <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֲפִּרְיוֹן‎</span>, <i lang="de">ein Prachtstück</i>. Kimchi derives it from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פָּרָה‎</span>, <i>to be fruitful</i>, and says it is called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אַפִּרְיוֹן‎</span>, because <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שפרין ורבין עליה‎</span>, <i>people increase and multiply therein</i>. But this is contrary to the description here given of the procession. Besides, a
<i>bridal bed</i> has no (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מֶרְכָּבָה‎</span>) <i>seat</i>. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עָשַׂה‎</span>, <i>to make</i>, means also <i>to have made</i>, <i>to order to be made</i>. A person is frequently described in Scripture idiom as doing that which he orders
to be done. 2 Sam. xv. 1; Gal. ii. 5, 6. The <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מִן‎</span> in <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מַעַצַי‎</span> denotes the material of which the frame-work was made. Ps. xlv. 4. <i>The wood of Lebanon</i>, i.e. cedars and cypresses, Zech. xi. 1, 2; 1 Chron. ii. 8.
</p>
<p><a href="#v3.10">10</a>. <i>Its pillars he hath made</i>, &amp;c. The description here given of the costly construction of this magnificent palanquin
is by no means a mere poetic embellishment. A similar litter was presented by the
British government in 1766 to the Nabob of the Carnatic, of which the following account
is given by Williams <i lang="la">in loco</i>, from the public prints of the time: “The beams are solid gold, the inside beautifully
decorated with silver lining and fringe throughout; the panels are painted in the
highest style of finishing, and represent various groups and heads of animals, after
the manner of Asia, beaded with gold richly raised above the surface, and engraved.
The stays and different other ornaments are of embossed silver.” Curtius (viii. 9,
23) <span class="pageNum" id="pb153n">[<a href="#pb153n">153</a>]</span>gives us a description of the procession of an Indian potentate, which strikingly
resembles the one here depicted. “When the king shows himself in public, his servants
go before him with silver censers, which fill the air, throughout the way along which
he is borne in the palanquin, with delicious odour. He himself is reclining upon a
golden couch, covered with pearls and veiled with purple curtains, embroidered with
gold; the life-guard bring up the rear.” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רְפִידָה‎</span> (from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רָפַד‎</span>, <i>to support</i>, ii. 5), <i>that which supports the back when sitting</i>; so the Sept. <span class="trans" title="anaklinon"><span lang="grc" class="grek"><span class="corr" id="xd31e9315" title="Source: ἀνάκλιντον">ἀνάκλινον</span></span></span>; Vulg. <i lang="la">reclinatorium</i>; Döpke, Rosenmüller, Hitzig, &amp;c. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מֶרְכָּב‎</span>, <i>a seat</i>, comp.

The words <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תּוֹכוֹ רָצוּף אַהֲבָה מִבְּנוֹת יְרוּשָּׁלַיִם‎</span>, are either to be translated: <i>its centre is tesselated most lovely, by the daughters of Jerusalem</i>;—the noun <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אַהֲבָה‎</span> may be used adverbially for <i>lovely</i>, <i>charmingly</i>, comp. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֹהֲבֵם נְדָבָה‎</span>, “I will love them <i>freely</i>,” Hos. xiv. 4; Ewald, § 279 c, § 204; so Luther, Kleuker, Herder, De Wette, Rosenmüller,

<p><a href="#v3.11">11</a>. <i>Come out, O ye daughters</i>, &amp;c. As the royal train begins to enter the city, a fourth bystander calls the daughters
of Zion to come out and see the monarch in his joyful attire. Thus the inspired writer
beautifully puts into the mouth of several spectators the description he desires to
give. The crown here mentioned is not the symbol of <i>royalty</i>, but the emblem of <i>happiness</i> (Job xix. 9). Crowns or chaplets of flowers were worn in ancient times on occasions
of festivity and rejoicing; comp. Apocryp. Wisdom, ii. 7, 8. Conjugal life being regarded
as the most happy, it became a custom among the Jews, as well as among other nations,
to put crowns on the heads of the newly-married people. Rosenmüller, Orient. iv. 196.
“In the Greek Church in Egypt,” says Maillet, “the parties are placed before a reading-desk
on which is the book of the Gospels, having two crowns upon it of flowers, cloth,
or tinsel. The priest, after benedictions and prayers, places one on the bridegroom’s,
the other on the bride’s head, covering both with a veil.” (See also Talmud, Sotha,
ix. 14; Selden, Uxor. Hebr. II. xv. 139; I.&nbsp;F. Hirt, <span lang="la">de Coronis apud Hebraeos nuptialibus sposi sposaeque</span>). The Jews still call the bridegroom <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מֶלֶךְ‎</span>, and the bride <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מַלְכָּה‎</span>. The design of Solomon in putting on this crown is evidently to dazzle the rustic
girl. The arrival and entrance of the royal train in the capital, recorded in verses
6–11, evidently show that the circumstances narrated in the preceding sections took
place out of Jerusalem, and that the apartments into which the king brought the damsel,
as stated in ch. i. 4, were not in the capital, but, <span class="pageNum" id="pb154n">[<a href="#pb154n">154</a>]</span>as we see from ch. vi. 11, 12, in the neighbourhood of the Shulamite’s home. The abnormal
<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צְאֶינָה‎</span> is here intentionally used instead of the normal <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צֵאנָה‎</span>, to correspond in form with <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רְאֶינָה‎</span>; just as <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מוֹבָא‎</span>, <i>entrance</i> (Ezek. xliii. 11), is employed instead of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מָבוֹא‎</span>, to correspond with <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מוֹצָא‎</span>, see also Jer. l. 20; Ezek. xvi. 50; infra, viii. 5; Gesen. § 59, Rem. 3; Ewald,
§ 118 d. The female inhabitants of the town are designedly called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בְּנוֹת צִיוֹן‎</span>, to distinguish them from the <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בְּנוֹת יְרוּשָׁלַיִם‎</span>, which is the appellation of the court ladies.
</p>
<p><a href="#v4.1">1</a>. <i>Behold, thou art</i>, &amp;c. The shepherd, who had followed afar off the royal train in which his beloved
was conveyed to the capital, obtains an interview with her, and is now addressing
her. <i>Thine eyes are doves</i>; see supra, i. 15. <i>Thy hair is like a flock of goats</i>, i.e. the tresses, dangling from the crown of her head, are as beautiful as Mount
Gilead covered with the shaggy herd. The hair of Oriental goats is exceedingly delicate,
soft (Gen. xxvii. 16), long, and black (1 Sam. xix. 13); and when the sun shines upon
it, reflects such a glare that the eye can hardly bear the lustre (see Boch. Hieroz.
i. 2, 51. Rosenmüller, Orient. i. 85). <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הַר גִּלְעָד‎</span> is the name of a chain of limestone mountains beyond Jordan, intersected by numerous
valleys (Gen. xxxi. 21; Jer. l. 19). This ridge extends over the regions inhabited
by the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the northern part of Manasseh (Numb. xxxii. 40;
Deut. iii. 13; Josh. xvii. 1–6). It was famous for its luxuriant verdure, aromatic
simples, and rich pastures; and hence attracted the flocks (Numb. xxxii. 1); and animals
from this region were regarded as of a superior quality, like gold from Ophir. Nothing,
therefore, could more beautifully express the curly hair of a woman, dangling down
from the crown of her head, than the sight, at a distance, of a flock of goats running
down from the summit of this verdant hill on a beautiful day. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צַמָּה‎</span> (from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צָמַם‎</span>, <i>i.q.</i> Chald. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צַמְצַם‎</span>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צָמַם‎</span>, <i>to bind</i>, <i>to twine</i>, <i>to veil</i>), is well explained by Rashbam, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ענין עילוף ומעטה היא‎</span>, <i>a kind of cover</i>, or <i>veil</i>; so Sym., Sept., Isa. xlvii. 2, Michaelis, Döpke, Gesenius, De Wette, Lee, Percy,
Williams, Hitzig, &amp;c. The rendering of the Sept. here, <span class="trans" title="ektos tēs siōpēseōs sou"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ἐκτὸς τῆς σιωπήσεώς σου</span></span>, <i>behind thy silence</i>, which is followed by the Syriac and Arabic, is both contrary to the etymology of
the word, and meaningless. The other translations, viz. <i>locks</i> (Auth. Vers., Ewald), <i>a plait of hair</i> (Hengstenberg), cannot be substantiated. The word <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גָּלַשׁ‎</span>, which occurs only here and vi. 5, is of difficult interpretation, and has produced
a variety of renderings. The Sept. has here <span class="trans" title="apekalyphthēsan"><span lang="grc" class="grek"><span class="corr" id="xd31e9496" title="Source: ἀπεκαλύφησαν">ἀπεκαλύφθησαν</span></span></span>, and vi. 5, <span class="trans" title="anephanēsan"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ἀνεφάνησαν</span></span>, the Syriac <span lang="syc" class="syrc">ܣܠܰܩ‎</span>, the Vulg. here <i lang="la">ascenderunt</i>, and vi. 5, <i>apparuerunt</i>. The Rabbins also differ in their interpretations. Rashi explains it <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שנקרחו‎</span>, <i>that make bare</i>, i.e. <i>quit</i> or <i>descend</i> the mountain. Ibn Ezra, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שנשקפו‎</span>, <i>which look down</i>; Rashbam, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שנראו‎</span>, <i>which are seen</i>, i.e. while coming down from the mount. Modern commentators are not less at variance.
Luther translates it <i>shorn</i>; Houbigant, <i>which hang down</i>; Kleuker, Ewald, <i>which shows itself</i>; Döpke, Gesenius, Hitzig, Philippson, <i>which lie down</i>; Magnus, <i>which climb up</i>; Percy, Hengstenberg, <i>which come up</i>, <i>i.e.</i> from Jerusalem. Amidst these conflicting opinions, it appears best to take <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גָּלַשׁ‎</span>, like its kindred <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פָּלַשׁ‎</span>, in the sense of <i>rolling down</i>, <i>running down</i>; see Fürst. Lexicon, s.v. This meaning <span class="pageNum" id="pb155n">[<a href="#pb155n">155</a>]</span>accords best with the comparison here used, and leaves to the preposition <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מִן‎</span> its natural signification. The omission of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הַר‎</span> in the Sept., Arabic, and a few MSS., is evidently owing to the carelessness of a
transcriber.
</p>
<p><a href="#v4.2">2</a>. <i>Thy teeth</i>, &amp;c. The compliment passed upon the black hair is followed by another on the white
teeth: “Thy teeth resemble in whiteness woolly sheep just washed.” This comparison
will appear more striking when we remember that the wool of Scripture is proverbial
for its whiteness, and is placed in juxtaposition with the colour of snow, Isa. i.
18; Dan. vii. 9; Rev. i. 14; Book of Enoch xlvi. 1. The Sept., which is followed by
many modern commentators, takes the comparison to be between the <i>shorn</i> skin of the sheep and the teeth; but this is untenable. For, 1. The skin of shorn
sheep can never have the whiteness which the context here demands; 2. Shorn sheep
would yield a very incongruous figure, if teeth were compared with them; 3. Sheep,
as now, were generally washed <i>before</i> and not <i>after</i> they were shorn; 4. The passage in vi. 6, shows that <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קְצוּבוֹת‎</span> is merely a poetical epithet for <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רְחֵלִים‎</span>, not because they were <i>then</i> shorn, but because they are <i>periodically</i> shorn. The explanation of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קְצוּבוֹת‎</span> by well <i>numbered</i> (Rashi), or by <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יש להן מדה אחת כאילו נחצבת כל אחת כמו חברתה‎</span>, <i>same size</i> (Kimchi, Ibn Ezra), are against vi. 6.
</p>
<p><i>All of which are paired.</i> That is, each upper tooth has its corresponding lower one; thus they, as it were,
appear in pairs, like this flock of white sheep, each of which keeps to its mate,
as they come up from the washing-pool. <i>And no one of them is deprived of its fellow</i>, i.e. no tooth is deprived of its corresponding one, just as none of the sheep is
bereaved of its companion. The Hiphil of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תָּאַם‎</span>, <i>to be double</i>, <i>to be pairs</i> (Exod. xxvi. 24; xxxvi. 29), <i>is to make double</i>, <i>to make pairs</i>, <i>to appear paired</i>. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שַׁכֻּלָּה‎</span> is <i>deprived</i>, <i>bereaved</i>, Jer. xviii. 21. On the masculine suffixes in <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כֻּלָּם‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בָּהֶם‎</span>, referring to <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קְצוּבוֹת‎</span>, <i>fem.</i>, see supra, ii. 7. The words <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שֶׁכֻּלָּם‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שַׁכֻּלָּה‎</span> form a paranomasia; see i. 2. The rendering of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מַתְאִימוֹת‎</span> by <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כלם יולדות תאומים‎</span>, <i>all bearing twins</i> (Kimchi, &amp;c.), which some try to justify by submitting that sheep as well as goats
in the East frequently bear twins (Arist. Hist. Anim. i. 6, 19; Theocret. i. 25; iii.
34), is incompatible with the figure. The teeth surely, which are here compared to
the flock, cannot be said to bear twins like the sheep. Those who attempt to get over
this difficulty by referring it to the <i>rows</i> of the teeth, are, to say the least, guilty of introducing a <i>new</i> subject.
</p>
<p><a href="#v4.3">3</a>. <i>Thy mouth is lovely.</i> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מִדְבָּר‎</span> is translated by the Sept., Syriac, Vulg., Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Rashbam, <i>speech</i>, <i>language</i>; but this is incompatible with the description here given, which depicts <i>the members</i> of the body, and not their <i>actions</i>. It is therefore more consonant with the context to take <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מִדְבָּר‎</span> as a poetical expression for <i>the instrument of speech</i>; not the <i>tongue</i> (Schultens, Kleuker, Döpke), which is kept within the mouth, and not when put out
(<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נָאֲוָה‎</span>) <i>beautiful</i>; but <i>the mouth itself</i>, (Ewald, Gesenius, De Wette, Umbreit, Rosenmüller, Meier, Philippson, &amp;c.) The objection
of Magnus (who translates it <i>voice</i>), and of Hitzig (who translates it <i>palate</i>), that the rendering of <i>mouth</i> would produce tautology, inasmuch as the mouth consists of the lips, and these have
already been described, is <span class="pageNum" id="pb156n">[<a href="#pb156n">156</a>]</span>gratuitous: for an individual may have lips like scarlet, and yet not have a <i>lovely mouth</i>. The <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מ‎</span> in <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מִדְבָּר‎</span>, added to the root <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דָבַר‎</span>, <i>to speak</i>, in order to form the noun, denotes <i>the instrument</i> with which one speaks: compare <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מַזְלֵג‎</span>, <i>an instrument</i> with which to draw out = <i>a fork</i>, from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏זָלַג‎</span>, <i>to draw out</i>; <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מַפְתֵּחַ‎</span>, <i>an instrument</i> for opening = <i>a key</i>, from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פָּתַח‎</span>, <i>to open</i>, Gesen. § 84, 14; Ewald, § 160, 6. This corroborates the rendering we defended.
</p>
<p><i>Like a part of</i>, &amp;c. That is, the rosy cheeks visible beneath the veil resemble the vermilioned part
of the pomegranate. Eastern poets frequently compare the colour of the cheeks with
pomegranates and apples. Thus in a Persian ode quoted by Sir William Jones: “The pomegranate
brings to my mind the blushes of my beloved, when her cheeks are covered with a modest
resentment:” and Ibn Challecan, as adduced by Magnus <i lang="la">in loco</i>: “Believest thou that the apple can divert my looks from thee, when I behold thy
cheeks?” Ibn Ezra, who is followed by some modern commentators, explains <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פֶּלַח‎</span> by <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ציץ הרמון האדום‎</span>, <i>the red flower of the <span class="corr" id="xd31e9764" title="Source: pomegrante">pomegranate</span></i>; but this is contrary to 2 Kings iv. 39, where the root <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פלח‎</span> is used for dissecting fruit, and 1 Sam. xxx. 12. Others again take the simile to
be between the interior of the pomegranate, when cut or burst open, and the cheeks;
but this being <i>flat</i> would by no means represent the <i>round</i> form of the coloured cheek here referred to. The comparison appears natural, striking,
and beautiful, according to Rashi’s explanation of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פֶּלַח‎</span>, viz. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חצי רמון שבחוץ שהוא אדום‎</span>, <i>that external half of the pomegranate which is red</i>, one half of the pomegranate being brown, and the other beautifully vermilioned,
intermixed with yellow and white; and it is to the latter part to which reference
is here made. So the Sept. <span class="trans" title="lepyron"><span lang="grc" class="grek">λέπυρον</span></span>, <i>the peel</i>, or <i>the external</i>. Rashbam, Döpke, Hitzig.
</p>
<p><a href="#v4.4">4</a>. <i>Thy neck is like</i>, &amp;c. That is, “The erect and bold carriage of thy neck, decked with ornaments, resembles
that high, commanding tower, adorned with trophies.” Though the text supplies us with
no clue for finding out what tower this was, yet the comparison implies that it must
have been one well known and celebrated for its imposing aspect and symmetrical proportions.
Sandys (iii. 137), who is followed by others, identifies this tower with some ruins
still found in the uttermost angle of Mount Zion, which bears that name. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ תַּלְפִּיּוֹת‎</span> is rendered by the Sept. <span class="trans" title="Thalphiōth"><span lang="grc" class="grek">Θαλφιώθ</span></span>, as a proper name; but there is no place known by such a name. Aquila has <span class="trans" title="eis epalxeis"><span lang="grc" class="grek">εἰς <span class="corr" id="xd31e9817" title="Source: ἔπαλξεις">ἐπάλξεις</span></span></span>: so Vulg. <i lang="la">cum propugnaculis</i>, battlements, Sym. <span class="trans" title="hypsē"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ὕψη</span></span>, <i>heights</i>; but it is difficult to divine how these renderings are to be made out from the form
and meaning of the word. The Talmud Jerushalmi, Berachoth, section 4, and Saadias
explain it <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תל שהכול פונים לו‎</span>, <i>an elevation towards which all look</i>, i.e. by which they are guided. Ibn Ezra seems to favour the view that <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לְתַלְפִּיּוֹת‎</span> is a compound of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לְתַלוֹת פִּיוֹת‎</span>, <i>for the suspension of arms</i>. But the Talmudic explanation rests upon the favourite whim of making a word of every
letter. Ibn Ezra’s explanation incurs the objection that <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פִּיוֹת‎</span>, by itself, never means <i>swords</i> or <i>arms</i>. Besides, it is evident that this interpretation owes its origin to the immediately
following clause, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֶלֶף הַמָּגֵן תָּלוּי עָלָיו‎</span>. Gesenius derives it from the Arabic <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תָּלַף‎</span>, <i>to destroy</i>; hence <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תַּלְפִּי‎</span>, <i>destructive</i>, <i>deadly</i>; poetically, for <i>arms</i>. But, apart from the difficulty of making <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תַּלְפִּיּוֹת‎</span>, even according to this derivation, to mean <i>weapons</i>, according to this rendering there is no connexion between this clause and the figure.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb157n">[<a href="#pb157n">157</a>]</span>It is therefore better, with Rashi and Rashbam, to take <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תַּלְפִּיּוֹת‎</span> as a contraction for <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תְּאַלְפִּיּוֹת‎</span> from the root <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אָלַף‎</span>, <i>to teach</i>. The radical <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏א‎</span> in the feeble verbs <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פ״א‎</span>, does not unfrequently fall away: thus <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏וַתַּזְרֵנִי‎</span>, 2 Sam. xxii. 40, for <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏וַתְּאַזְּרֵנִי‎</span>, and in the same verb, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מַלְּפֵנוּ‎</span> for <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מְאַלְּפֵנוּ‎</span>, Job xxxv. 11; Gesen. § 68, 2; Ewald, § 54. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תַּלְפִּיּוֹת‎</span> (plur. of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תלפית‎</span>, according to the analogy of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תַּבְנִיוֹת‎</span>, from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תַּבְנִית‎</span>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תַּרְמִיוֹת‎</span>, from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תַּרְמִית‎</span>), would therefore signify <i>instruction</i>; the plural being here used for the abstract, see supra, i. 2. This derivation is
confirmed by the Chald., which periphrases <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תַּלְפִּיּוֹת‎</span> by <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אוּלְפַן דְּאֹורַיְתָא‎</span>, <i>instruction of the <span class="corr" id="xd31e9948" title="Source: low">law</span></i>, and bears out the figure, and yields a beautiful sense. The Shulamite’s neck is
not compared to some common turret, but to that splendid tower which was built for
a model, that, as Rashbam rightly remarks, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כל אומנין בנאים מתלמדים ממנו‎</span>, <i>all architects might learn their designs from it</i>.
</p>
<p><i>A thousand shields</i>, &amp;c. It was customary to adorn the walls of towers and castles with all sorts of
splendid arms, Ezek. xxvii. 11. The castles of the maritime people, whose conquest
is recorded by the Kouyunjik bas-reliefs, and distinguished by the shields hung round
the walls. Layard’s Nineveh, ii. 296. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֶלֶף‎</span>, <i>thousand</i> stands for <i>a round, large member</i>, Isa. xxx. 17; lx. 22; Ps. cv. 8; Eccl. vi. 6. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כֹּל‎</span>, <i>all kinds</i>, <i>all sorts</i>, see supra, iii. 6.
</p>
<p><a href="#v4.5">5</a>. <i>Thy bosom</i>, &amp;c. The point of comparison is the lovely sight which these objects present. The
gazelles, as we have seen (ii. 7), are the symbol of beauty. To add however to their
native charms, they are represented here as browzing in pasture-ground abounding with
lilies. To this lovely spectacle, than which nothing could be more beautiful to an
Oriental, her breasts are compared. The explanation which Bochart, Patrick, Henley,
Percy, Good, give of this comparison, viz. “The two <i>paps</i> rise upon the breast like lilies from the ground; among which, if we conceive two
red kids feeding, that were twins and perfectly alike, they appeared like the <i>nipples</i> or <i>teats</i> upon the paps, to those that behold them afar off,” is extravagant.
</p>
<p><a href="#v4.6">6</a>. <i>When the day cools</i>, &amp;c. Transported with joy at the sight of her beloved shepherd, the Shulamite interrupts
the praises of her personal charms, which, on seeing her again, he began to pour forth,
by exclaiming: <i>When the day cools</i>, that is, “this very evening, as soon as it gets dark, I will quit the royal abode,
and go to our beautiful and open country, to the flowery meads, where are found aromatic
plants growing in abundance.” For an explanation of the first part of this verse,
see ii. 17, also spoken by the Shulamite. That such mountains of myrrh and hills of
frankincense actually existed, is evident from Florus, <span lang="la">Epitome Rerum Rom., lib. iii. c. 6.</span>, where Pompey the Great is said to have passed over Lebanon, and by Damascus, “<span lang="la">per nemora illa odorata, per thuris et balsami sylvas.</span>”
</p>
<p>7, 8. <i>Thou art all beautiful</i>, &amp;c. Gladdened <span class="pageNum" id="pb158n">[<a href="#pb158n">158</a>]</span>with her declaration, the shepherd, crowning and closing his description in the words,
“Thou art a perfect beauty,” responds, “Thou shalt go with me, I will help thee to
quit these lofty heights, the abode of lions and panthers—the royal residence; and
safely conduct thee to the place whither thou wouldst go.” Lebanon is the name of
a long range of mountains on the north of Palestine (Deut. ii. 24; Josh. i. 4), consisting
of two parallel chains, which run from south-west to north-east. Though the Scriptures
have only one name, viz. Lebanon, for both these chains, yet the present inhabitants
of that country, as well as modern Travellers, have found it convenient to call the
westermost chain, facing the Mediterranean,—Lebanon; and the eastern one, facing the
plain of Damascus,—Anti-Libanus, from its being at Tyre, parallel with and opposite
to the Syrian Lebanon. <i>Amana</i>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֲמָנָה‎</span>, is the name of the southern part of Anti-Libanus, at the root of which, it is supposed,
issues the river of the same name; see 2 Kings v. 12. <i>Hermon</i>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חֶרְמֹון‎</span>, is the name of the highest summit of a chain at the northernmost boundary of Palestine,
and belongs also to Anti-Libanus (Josh. xi. 17; xiii. 5), and is now identified with
Jebel-el-Sheikh. It consists of several mountains, viz. <i>Sirion</i>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שִׁרְיוֹן‎</span>, <i>Shenir</i>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שְׁנִיר‎</span>, and <i>Sion</i>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שִׂיאֹן‎</span>; whence its plural name <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חֶרְבוֹנִים‎</span>, see Fürst, Lexicon, s.v. Lebanon, Amana, Shenir and Hermon are here not intended
to denote various parts of the range of mountains, but are merely different names
of the royal residence. The word <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תַּשׁוּרִי‎</span> is well rendered by the Sept., Syriac, &amp;c., <i>thou shalt go</i>; comp. Isa. lvii. 9. The Common Version <i>look</i> is incompatible with the context and parallelism. Surely no one would invite his
beloved to go with him to dangerous mountain-tops, to take a view of the country!
Persons are generally anxious to avoid perilous places. The lions and panthers denote
the king and his courtiers, Ezek. xix. 7; xxii. 25; Nahum ii. 12. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כָּלָה‎</span>, rendered <i>spouse</i> in the Authorized Version, is taken by some to denote <i>a newly-married woman</i>. The word however only means <i>betrothed</i> = a female under <i>an engagement</i> to marry. This is the sense in which the Jews still use the expression. The Sept.,
which is followed by the Vulg. and Luther, translates <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אִתִּי‎</span>, <span class="trans" title="deuro"><span lang="grc" class="grek">δεῦρο</span></span>, mistaking it for <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֲתִי‎</span>, the imp. of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אָתָּה‎</span>, <i>to come</i>. The Vulg. rendering of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תָּשׁוּרִי‎</span> by <i lang="la">coronaberis</i>, evidently savours of allegorism. For the Septuagint’s rendering of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֲמָנָה‎</span>, by <span class="trans" title="pistis"><span lang="grc" class="grek">πίστις</span></span>, see Introduction, p. 21.
</p>
<p><a href="#v4.9">9</a>. <i>Thou hast put heart into me</i>, &amp;c. This extraordinary amount of strength and courage which he feels, to enable
him to rescue her from the abode of the lion, and to lead her safely home, has been
infused into his heart, he says, by the sight of his beloved one. So the Anonymous
Oxford Manuscript, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שבשביל אהבתך נתגברתי ונבוא לי לב חדש שיש לי כח ללחם עם האריות והנמרים‎</span>. As the Piel has sometimes an <i>intensive</i>, and sometimes a <i>privative</i> meaning (see Gesen. § 52, 2; Ewald, § 120), a difference <span class="pageNum" id="pb159n">[<a href="#pb159n">159</a>]</span>of opinion exists as to the signification of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לִבֵּב‎</span> here. The Sept. has <span class="trans" title="ekkardiōsas hēmas"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ἐκκαρδίωσας ἡμᾶς</span></span>, <i>thou hast unhearted us</i>; the Vulg. <i lang="la">Vulnerasti cor meum</i>; Ibn Ezra, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לקחת לבי‎</span>, <i>thou hast taken away my heart</i>; Gesenius, De Wette, &amp;c. adopt this rendering. Against this however it is urged,
that it is incompatible with the context. The beloved here accounts for his extraordinary
strength and courage, which would enable him to rescue his beloved one from her critical
position; and to say, “Thou hast deprived me of all heart,” would be a positive contradiction.
To be in such an unusually courageous frame, the individual must have been <i>full of heart</i>, and not <i>disheartened</i>. Hence Herder, Ewald, Döpke, Lee, Meier, &amp;c., translate <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לִבַּבְתִּנִי‎</span>, <i>thou hast put heart into me</i>; <i>thou hast made me bold</i>. This is confirmed by Sym., Syriac, Arabic, and Chald. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אַחוֹתִי‎</span>, <i>my sister</i>, does not imply that the betrothed was related to her beloved, but is used as an
expression of endearment, Prov. vii. 14; Tobit vii. 12; the Apoc. Esth. xv. 8, and
<i>soror</i> in Latin. Good’s rendering of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אַחֹתִי כַלָּה‎</span> by <i>my sister-spouse</i>, and his remark that the pronoun “my” between the two substantives, being a useless
interpretation of the versions, are gratuitous. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כָּלָּה‎</span> has no suffix here, not because it is to be joined with <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֲחֹתי‎</span>, but because this word, like <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אָב‎</span> in Chald., never takes the suffix 1 pers.; and versions therefore made in languages
whose idioms allow of the suffix are right in so expressing it.
</p>
<p><i>With one of thine eyes</i>, &amp;c. It is customary with Eastern women to unveil one of their eyes in conversation,
in which case a part of their neck ornaments becomes also visible. Niebuhr, Travels
in Arabia, i. 262; see Kitto, Cyclop. Bib. Lit. Art. Veil, figure 536, and infra,
viii. 9. The Anonymous MS., however, explains <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בְּאֶחַד מֵעֵינַיִךְ‎</span> by <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בהבטה אחת שאת מבטת בי באחד מעיניך‎</span>, <i>one look of thine eyes</i>. The rendering <i>at once</i> (Hodgson, Good) is incongruous. The attempt of the Masorites to substitute <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בַּאַחַת‎</span>, <i>fem.</i><span class="corr" id="xd31e10184" title="Not in source">,</span> for <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בְּאֶחַד‎</span>, <i>mas<span class="corr" id="xd31e10191" title="Not in source">.</span></i>, having evidently arisen from their anxiety to avoid the apparent incongruity of
coupling a masculine numeral with a feminine noun, is unnecessary. The true solution
lies in the fact, that members of the human body, although usually feminine, are most
of them employed occasionally as masculine. Job xxi. 20; Zech. iv. 10; and infra,
vi. 5; Gesen. § 107, 4 b; Ewald, § 174 d. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עֲנָקָ‎</span> is not <i>look</i> (Vulg.), nor <i>turn</i> (Percy, Good), nor <i>stone</i> (Ewald, Magnus), but <i>chain</i>. This is evident from Judg. viii. 26, and Prov. i. 9, the only two passages where
this word occurs again (except as a proper name), and is translated by the Sept. (Judg.
and Prov.) <span class="trans" title="kloios"><span lang="grc" class="grek">κλοιός</span></span>, <i>necklace</i>, Aquila, <span class="trans" title="peritrachēlios"><span lang="grc" class="grek">περιτραχήλιος</span></span>, <span class="trans" title="plokamos"><span lang="grc" class="grek">πλόκαμος</span></span>, <i>neckband</i>, <i>neck-work</i>; Sym. <span class="trans" title="kloios"><span lang="grc" class="grek">κλοιός</span></span>, <span class="trans" title="hormiskos"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ὁρμίσκος</span></span>, <i>necklace</i>; Vulg. (Judg. and Prov.) <i lang="la">torques</i>. So Ibn Ezra, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מני חלי קשוריﬦ על הצואר‎</span>, <i>a kind of ornamental band, tied round the neck</i>, Rashi, Rashbam, Gesenius, De Wette, Döpke, Lee, Philippson, Meier, Hengstenberg,
&amp;c. The objection urged by Hitzig, that an inanimate ornament could not effect such
great things, is obviated by a reference to the Book of Judith, xvi. 9, where we are
informed that the fair one succeeded in captivating even the savage Holofernes with
her sandals: <span class="trans" title="to sandalion autēs hērpasen ophthalmon autou"><span lang="grc" class="grek">τὸ σανδάλιον αὐτῆς ἥρπασεν ὀφθαλμὸν αὐτοῦ</span></span>. Besides, the meaning here is, that the slightest view of her is sufficient to inspire
him with vigour and courage. The termination <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏–וֹן‎</span> in <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צַּוָּרוֹן‎</span>, like <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏וּן‎</span>, in Syriac, forms the <i>diminutive</i>; and, like diminutives in other languages, is expressive of affection; Gesen. § 86,
2, 4; Ewald, 5, 167 a. The plur. termination <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏–ָיִךְ‎</span> in <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מִצֲוְּרֹנָיִךְ‎</span>, is to be accounted for on the score that the Hebrews sometimes use plural forms
for certain members of the body. Comp. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פָּנִיﬦ‎</span>, <i>face</i>, Gesen. § 108, 2 a; Ewald, § 178 a.
</p>
<p><a href="#v4.10">10</a>. <i>How sweet is thy love</i>, &amp;c. Here <span class="pageNum" id="pb160n">[<a href="#pb160n">160</a>]</span>the lover tells his loved one why the sight of her is so animating and emboldening<span class="corr" id="xd31e10302" title="Source: ,">.</span> For the comparison of love with wine, see i. 2, 3. The Sept., which is followed by
the Syriac, Vulg., Arabic, and Luther, has here again <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דַדֶּיךָ‎</span>, <i>thy breasts</i>; but see i. 2. The Sept. has also <span class="trans" title="osmē himatiōn sou"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ὀσμὴ <span class="corr" id="xd31e10315" title="Source: ἱμάτιων">ἱματίων</span> σου</span></span>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏וְרֵיחַ שִׂמְלֹתַיִךְ‎</span>, for <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏וְרֵיחַ שְׁמָנַיִךְ‎</span>, evidently taken from the following verse.
</p>
<p><a href="#v4.11">11</a>. <i>Thy lips, O my betrothed</i>, &amp;c. Every word which falls from her lips is like a drop from the honeycomb. This
comparison is used in other parts of Scripture, and by the Greeks and Romans. Thus
Prov. v. 3:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“The harlot’s lips distil honey, </p>
<p class="line">And her palate is smoother than oil.” </p>
</div>
<p class="first">Theocrit. Idyl. xx. 26:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line"><span class="trans" title="to stoma kai paktas glykerōteron; ek stomatōn de"><span lang="grc" class="grek">τὸ στόμα καὶ πακτᾶς γλυκερώτερον· ἐκ στομάτων δὲ</span></span> </p>
<p class="line"><span class="trans" title="errhee moi phōna glykerōtera ē meli kērō."><span lang="grc" class="grek">ἔῤῥεέ μοι φωνὰ γλυκερωτέρα <span class="corr" id="xd31e10359" title="Source: ἤ">ἢ</span> μέλι κήρω.</span></span> </p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">“More sweet my lips than milk in luscious rills, </p>
<p class="line">Lips, whence pure honey, as I speak, distils.” </p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">Also Idyl. i. 146, 8, 82; Homer, Iliad, i. 249; Hor. Epist. i. 19, 44. That we are
to understand by distilling honey, “lovely words,” and not <i lang="la">saliva oris osculantis</i>, is evident from Prov. xvi. 24, where pleasant words are compared to a honeycomb,
and the passage already quoted, just as slanderous words are represented as poisons,
Ps. cxl. 3.
</p>
<p><i>And the odour of thy garments</i>, &amp;c. The Orientals were in the habit of perfuming their clothes with aromatics. Thus
we are told that the garments of Jacob emitted a pleasant smell, Gen. xxviii. 27;
Ps. xlv. 9; Rosenmüller, Orient. i. 122. In consequence of the odoriferous trees which
abounded on it, Lebanon became proverbial for fragrance. Hence the prophet Hosea (xiv.
7), describing the prosperous state of repenting Israel, says <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏וְרֵיחַ לוֹ כַּלְבַנוֹן‎</span>, <i>and his odour shall be as that of Lebanon</i>. This passage is sufficient to show the error of the Vulg. in rendering <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כְּרֵיחַ לְבָנוֹן‎</span> by <i lang="la">sicut odor thuris</i>, as if it were <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כְּרֵיחַ לְבוֹנָה‎</span>. The perfumed attire which the Shulamite had on, and which the shepherd here praises,
is evidently not the humble clothes which she had brought with her, but some splendid
apparel recently given to her by the king.
</p>
<p><a href="#v4.12">12</a>. <i>A closed garden</i>, &amp;c. The trees of Lebanon, referred to at the end of the last verse, suggested this
beautiful metaphor of a garden, under which the shepherd describes the unsullied purity
and chastity of the Shulamite. Gardens in the East were generally hedged or walled
in, to prevent the intrusion of strangers (Isa. v. 5; Joseph. De Bell. Jud. vii.).
From this arose the epithet, “closed garden,” for a virtuous woman, shut up against
every attempt to alienate her affections. The contrary figure is used in viii. 9;
there accessibility is described as “a door,” <i>i.e.</i> open to seduction.
</p>
<p><i>A sealed fountain</i>, &amp;c. Another metaphor to express the same idea. The scarcity of water in arid countries
renders fountains very valuable. To secure them against the encroachment of strangers,
the proprietors formerly fastened their fountains with some ligament, and the impression
of a seal upon clay, which would quickly harden in the sun, that would soon dissolve
wax. This mode of rendering pits safe is found in Dan. vi. 18; Matt. xxvii. 66. A
fountain sealed in this manner indicated that it was private property. Hence its metaphorical
use, to represent chastity as an inaccessible <span class="pageNum" id="pb161n">[<a href="#pb161n">161</a>]</span>fountain. It is better, with the Sept., Syriac, Arabic, Chald., Vulg., upwards of
fifty of Kennicott’s MSS., and many modern commentators, to read <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גַּן‎</span>, instead of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גַּל‎</span>. This is confirmed by the intensive phraseology of the shepherd, used in his addresses,
which is produced by a repetition of the same words. Comp. supra, vv. 8, 9.
</p>
<p><a href="#v4.13">13</a>. <i>Thy shoots</i>, &amp;c. Having compared his loved one to a garden, the shepherd is anxious to show that
the one she resembled is not of an ordinary character. It is an orchard full of the
most costly trees, and producing the most delicious fruit. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שְׁלָחַיִךְ‎</span>, well rendered by the Sept. <span class="trans" title="apostolai sou"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ἀποστολαί σου</span></span>: and Kimchi, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏התפשטות‎</span>, <i>thy shoots</i>, <i>branches</i> (Gen. xlix. 21; Ps. lxxx. 12) is figuratively used for the members of the body, and
not for “the children who shall spring from her,” as Hodgson supposes. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פַּרְדֵּס‎</span>, found elsewhere only Eccl. ii. 5; Neh. ii. 8, has been derived by some from the
Persian, and by others from the Sanscrit. There is no necessity, however, for seeking
its etymology in other languages. The Hebrews, who had gardens at so early a period,
would surely not borrow names for them from other nations. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פַּרְדֵּס‎</span>, according to the analogy of the quadriliteral <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פַּרְשֵׁז‎</span>, is a compound of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פָּרַד‎</span>, <i>to divide</i>, and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פָּרַס‎</span>, <i>to separate</i>, <i>to enclose</i>; hence <i>a protected, an enclosed place</i>, <i>a garden</i>. This is corroborated by the fact that <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גַּן‎</span>, <i>a garden</i>, is also derived from a root (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גָּנַן‎</span>), which means <i>to separate</i>, <i>to enclose</i>. Compare also the German and English, <i lang="de">Gärten</i>, <i>garden</i>, and Saalschütz, <span lang="de"><span class="corr" id="xd31e10487" title="Source: Archäelogie">Archäologie</span> der Hebräer</span>, vol. i. p. 117. And like many other Hebrew expressions, this word was adopted in
other languages. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רִמּוֹנִים‎</span>, <i>pomegranate-trees</i>: the Hebrews frequently use the same expression to denote the tree and its fruit,
see supra, ii. 3. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פְּרִי מְגָדִים‎</span>, <i>i.q.</i> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פִּרְיֵיְ מֶגָד‎</span>, <i>precious fruits</i>: when a compound idea is to be expressed in the plural, the governed noun only is
often put in the plural form; <i>e.g.</i> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בֵּית אָבוֹת‎</span>, <i>ancestral houses</i>, Numb. i. 2; Gesen. § 108, 3. The precious fruits are those of the pomegranate-tree.
The words <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כְּפָרִים עִם נְרָדִים‎</span>, are still genitives to <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פַּרְדֵּס‎</span>. For <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כֹּפֶר‎</span>, and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נֵרְדְּ‎</span>, see supra, i. 12, 13.
</p>
<p><a href="#v4.14">14</a>. <i>Nard and crocus</i>, &amp;c. Both the ancient versions and modern commentators generally agree that by the
word <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כַּרְכֹּﬦ‎</span>, which occurs only here, the well-known <i>saffron plant</i> is meant. Calamus (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קָנֶה‎</span>, <i>reed</i>, also written <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קְנֵה בשֵֹׁם‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קָנֶה הַטּוֹב‎</span>, <i>sweet calamus</i>, Exod. xxx. 23; Jer. vi. 20, <span class="trans" title="kalamos arōmatikos"><span lang="grc" class="grek">κάλαμος ἀρωματικός</span></span>, Calamus odoratus), was well known and highly prized among the ancients, and was
imported to Palestine from India (Jer. vi. 20; xxvii. 19); it was, however, also found
in the valley of Mount Lebanon, (Polyb. v. 46; Strabo, xvi. 4). It has a reed-like
stem, of a tawny colour, much jointed, breaking into splinters, and its hollow reed
filled with pitch, like the web of a spider. The best, which, according to Pliny (Hist.
Nat. xii. 12 or 48), grows in Arabia, diffuses around a very agreeable odour, and
is soft to the touch (see Rosenmüller, Bib. Bot.; Winer, Bib. Dict.; Kitto, Cyclop.
Bib. Lit. s.v.) Cinnamon (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קִנָּמוֹן‎</span>, <span class="trans" title="kinamon"><span lang="grc" class="grek">κίναμον</span></span>, <i>Laurus cinnamomum</i>), indigenous to Ceylon in the East Indies, and is called by the natives <i>Karonda-gouhah</i>; it is now, however, also cultivated on the Malabar coast, in the islands of Sumatra
and Borneo, in China and Cochin-China. The cinnamon-tree, which grows on the coast,
is generally about twenty or thirty feet high, and reaches a still greater height
in groves: it is adorned with numerous boughs, bearing oval and laurel-like leaves,
of a scarlet <span class="pageNum" id="pb162n">[<a href="#pb162n">162</a>]</span>colour when young, but changing to bright green, and growing to the length of from
four to six inches when matured, and putting forth whitish blossoms, which ripen into
fruit, resembling those of the juniper-tree in June: the fruit, though possessing
neither the smell nor the taste of the cinnamon, when boiled secretes an oil, which,
after cooling, becomes hard, white, and fragrant. The wood itself, which is white,
inodorous, and soft as fir, is used for a variety of purposes. It is the rind which,
when peeled off and dried in the sun, yields the much-valued cinnamon. (See Rosenmüller,
Bibl. Bot.; Winer, Bib. Dict.; Kitto, Cyclop. Bib. Lit. s.v.) <i>Aloe</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אָהָל‎</span>, <span class="trans" title="Aloē"><span lang="grc" class="grek">Ἀλοή</span></span>. John xix. 39. <span class="trans" title="agallochon"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ἀγάλλοχον</span></span>, <span class="trans" title="xylaloē"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ξυλαλοή</span></span><span id="xd31e10607"></span>, <i>arbor alois</i>), a tree which grows in India and the Moluccas, the wood of which is highly aromatic.
The stem of this tree is as thick as a man’s thigh; the top is adorned with a bunch
of thick and indented leaves, broad below, and narrowing gradually towards the point,
and are about four feet long: its blossoms—which are red, intermixed with yellow,
and double like a pink—yield the pod, producing a red and white fruit, about the size
of a pea. This tree, in consequence of its singularly beautiful appearance and odoriferous
wood, which is used as a perfume, is very gratifying both to the sight and smell,
and is held by the Indians in sacred veneration. (See Rosenmüller, Bib. Bot.; Winer,
Bib. Dict. s.v.) <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רֹאשׁ‎</span>, <i>head</i> metaph., <i>chief</i>, <i>most excellent</i>. Exod. xxx. 23; Ps. cxxxvii. 6; Ezek. xxvii. 22.
</p>
<p><a href="#v4.15">15</a>. <i>With a garden-fountain</i>, &amp;c. To finish the picture of this charming garden, the shepherd introduces into
it fountains, streams, rills, and cooling breezes, to rouse and waft the balmy fragrance
through its delightful retreats. The fact that the Shulamite has been called a <i>sealed</i> fountain proves that this verse is not descriptive of her. For it would be contradictory
to call her in one verse a <i>sealed</i> fountain, and in the other a stream <i>flowing</i> from Lebanon, i.e. an <i>open stream</i>. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מַעְיַן גַּנִּים‎</span> a fountain of gardens, i.e. a fountain belonging to gardens, usually found in gardens
to irrigate them. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נֹזְליִם‎</span>, a part. noun plur., denoting flowing streams. The <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מִן‎</span> indicates <i>the place</i> whence these streams issue. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מַיִם חַיִּים‎</span> <i>living water</i>, i.e. perennial; waters, gushing forth from fountains, or moving along, appear as
if they were <i>living</i>; whilst those in a stagnant condition seem <i>dead</i>. Gen. xxvi. 19; Jer. ii. 13; Zech. xiv. 8; see also <span class="trans" title="hydōr zōn"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ὕδωρ ζῶν</span></span>, Rev. vii. 17, and <i>flumen vivum</i>, Virg. Æn. ii. 719.
</p>
<p><a href="#v4.16">16</a>. <i>Arise, O north wind!</i> These are still the words of the shepherd, who, to complete the picture, invokes
the gentle breezes to perflate this paradise. Rashbam, Ibn Ezra, Williams, Good, Ewald,
Delitzsch, Philippson, &amp;c., take this clause to begin her reply; but this is incompatible
with the figure. She <i>herself</i>, and not anything <i>separate</i>, has been described as this charming garden. She could, therefore, not say “blow
through <span class="asc">MY</span> garden” (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גַנִּי‎</span>), which would imply that this garden of hers was something <i>apart</i> from her person. Moreover, the expression <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גַנּוֹ‎</span>, <i>his garden</i>, which she uses, shows that <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גַנִּי‎</span>, <i>my garden</i>, is spoken by him. So Rashi, Döpke, Magnus, Hitzig, &amp;c. That the south and north
winds are merely poetical <span class="pageNum" id="pb163n">[<a href="#pb163n">163</a>]</span>designations for a gale generally, without any particular reference to the peculiarities
of the wind when blowing from these respective regions is evident from a comparison
of Numb. xi. 31 with Ps. lxxviii. 26. This does away with the conflicting conjectures
which have been hazarded, to account for the invocation of the wind from these opposite
quarters of the earth. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צָפוֹן‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תֵּימָן‎</span>, prop. the north and southern <i>quarters</i>, are poetically used, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רוּחַ צָפוֹן‎</span>, and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רוּחַ תֵּימָן‎</span>, the north and south <i>wind</i>. Ps. lxviii. 26. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בְּשָׂמִים‎</span>, <i>spices</i>, here <i>their odours</i>.
</p>
<p><i>Let my beloved come</i>, &amp;c. The Shulamite, continuing this beautiful apostrophe, responds: “If my person
really resembles such a paradise, this garden is yours; yours are all its productions.”
<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פְּרִי מְגָדָיו‎</span>, literally <i>the fruit of his deliciousness</i>, i.e. his <i>delicious</i> fruit. When a compound idea is expressed by one noun followed by another in the genitive,
a suffix which refers to this whole idea is sometimes appended to the second of the
two nouns. Comp. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֱלִילֵי כַּסְפּוֹ‎</span>, <i>his silver idols</i>, Isa. ii. 20; Gesen. § 129, b; Ewald, § 291, b; <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גַן‎</span> being of a common gender, the suffix in <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מְגָדָיו‎</span> may either refer to <i>garden</i>, or to <i>beloved</i>; it is more in keeping with the construction to refer it to the beloved, just as
the suffix in <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גַּנְּוֹ‎</span> refers to him. The fruit is the beloved’s because the garden is his, and therefore
he may enjoy it.
</p>
<p><a href="#v5.1">1</a>. <i>I am coming into my garden</i>, &amp;c. The shepherd, as he embraces his beloved, expresses his unbounded delight in
her charms. The perfect forms, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בָּאתִי שָׁתִיתִי‎</span>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אָכַלְתִּי‎</span>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אָרִתִי‎</span>, are used for the <i>present</i>, Gesen. § 126.
</p>
<p><i>Eat, O friends</i>, &amp;c. Some sympathizing court ladies, at a distance, seeing the mutual happiness of
the lovers, urge them to take their fill of delight. The explanation of Rashbam and
others, that this address is to the companions of the beloved to partake of a friendly
meal; or, as others will have it, that it is an invitation to the marriage feast,
is against the context. The expression <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אִכְלוּ‎</span>, <i>eat ye</i>, must be taken in the same sense as <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אָכַלְתִי‎</span>, <i>I eat</i>; and it would be most incongruous to suppose that the beloved, who enjoys the charms
of his loved one, would call on his friends to do the same. Dr. Geddes, who is followed
by Dr. Good, alters the text into <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אכל רעי שת ושכיר דודי‎</span>, <i>Eat, O my friend! drink, yea, drink abundantly, O my beloved!</i> and puts it into the mouth of the Shulamite; thus making it an answer to what the
beloved said in the preceding clause. But such conjectural emendations ought to be
repudiated. It is most in accordance with the context to take these words as an epiphonema
of some sympathizing court ladies. The parallelism and the accents require us to take
<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דוֹדִים‎</span> as a <i>concrete</i>, synonymous with <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רֵעִים‎</span>, <i>friends</i>; so the Sept., Vulg., Syr., Rashbam, Ibn Ezra, Rashi, Mendelssohn, &amp;c.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb164n">[<a href="#pb164n">164</a>]</span></p>
<p><a href="#v5.2">2</a>. <i>I was sleeping</i>, &amp;c. The sympathies manifested by some of the court ladies for the Shulamite, at
the close of the last section, encourage her to relate to them a dream which she recently
had. The purpose of this narration is the description of the shepherd to which it
leads, and which is necessary to the completion of the whole drama. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יְשֵׁנָה‎</span>, like the participle form generally, may be used to express <i>all</i> the relations of time. Comp. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כִּי כֻלָּם יְשֵׁנִים‎</span>, <i>for all were sleeping</i>, 1 Sam. xxvi. 12; 1 Kings iii. 20. Gesen. § 134, 1; Ewald, § 306 d. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לֵב‎</span>, <i>heart</i>, here the <i>seat of thought</i>. The Hebrews regarded the heart, not only as the seat of the passions, but also of
the intellectual faculties of the mind. The whole clause is merely another way of
saying <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בַּחֲלֹמִי‎</span>, Gen. xli. 17. The circumlocution is chosen in preference to <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בַּחֲלמִי‎</span>, to indicate that the powers under which the exhausted frame succumbed, could not
keep her mind from dwelling upon the object of her affections. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קֹל‎</span>, <i>hark</i>; <span lang="la">vide supra</span>, ii. 8. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דֹפֵק‎</span> is best taken with the Sept., Syriac, Vulg., and many modern commentators, as a separate
clause, <i>he is knocking</i>. The Sept. adds <span class="trans" title="epi tēn thyran"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ἐπὶ τὴν θύραν</span></span>, <i>at the door</i>, <i>after</i> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דֹפֵק‎</span>, he is knocking.
</p>
<p><i>Open to me</i>, &amp;c. She introduces him speaking. To make his request the more urgent, he pleads
that he had <span class="pageNum" id="pb165n">[<a href="#pb165n">165</a>]</span>been drenched with dew. The dew falls so copiously in the East, during certain months,
that it saturates the clothes like rain. See Judges vi. 38; Rosenmüller, Orient. i.
122; Winer, Bib. Dict. s.v. A similar passage occurs in Anacreon, iii. 10, where love
is represented as standing at night behind the door, begging for admittance, and pleading
the same excuses.

</p>
<p><i>I have washed my feet</i>, &amp;c. In the East, where people wear sandals, which protect the soles only, or go
barefoot, as in the passage before us, the feet soon get dirty and parched; it is
therefore essential and refreshing to wash the feet after much walking (Gen. xviii.
4; xix. 2), or before retiring to rest: remembering this, we can appreciate the hospitality
shown to travellers in providing for the washing of their feet, Judges xix. 21. On
the masculine suffix in <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֲטַנְּפַם‎</span>, referring to the feminine <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רַגְלַי‎</span>, see iv. 9.
</p>
<p><a href="#v5.4">4</a>. <i>My beloved withdrew his hand</i>, &amp;c. Hearing her excuses for not getting up, he at last grew weary and ceased knocking,
which immediately caused her uneasiness. The words <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שָׁלַח יָדוֹ מִן הַחוֹר‎</span> are better translated, <i>he sent away his hand from the hole</i> = withdrew; so the Sept. and Rashbam, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ההזירה לעצמו מן החור בדלת‎</span>, <i>he took his hand back from the hole in the door</i>. The expression <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מֵעִים‎</span>, like <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רַחֲמִים‎</span>, has not the <i>modern</i> sense of bowels, which is restricted to the <i>lower viscera</i>, but denotes, like <span class="trans" title="ta splanchna"><span lang="grc" class="grek">τὰ σπλάγχνα</span></span> in Greek, the <i>upper viscera</i>, comprising the heart, lungs, liver, &amp;c. Hence it is used for the heart alone as
the seat of passion, Isa. lxiii. 15; Jer. xxxi. 20; and for <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נֶפֶשׁ‎</span>, <i>soul</i>, Job xxx. 27; Ps. xl. 9. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הָמָה‎</span>, <i>to hum</i>, <i>to make a noise</i>, which is frequently used for the roaring produced by the waves of the troubled sea
(Isa. li. 15; Ps. xlvi. 4; Jer. v. 22), is employed to denote the motion of an <i>agitated heart</i>. With upwards of fifty MSS. and several editions we read <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עָלַי‎</span>, <i>in me</i>, instead of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עָלָיו‎</span>, <i>to him</i>; the phrase thus exactly corresponds to <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תֶּהֱמִי נַפְשִׁי עָלָי‎</span>, Ps. xlii. 6, 12.
</p>
<p><a href="#v5.5">5</a>. <i>My hands dropped with myrrh</i>, &amp;c. Alarmed at his ceasing to knock, she flew at once to open the door, and in trying
to unfasten it, her hands came <span class="pageNum" id="pb166n">[<a href="#pb166n">166</a>]</span>in contact with the liquid myrrh which her beloved had poured upon the bolts, and
which dropped from her fingers. So Immanuel, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כי שרצתי לפתח לדודי ונגעתי בידי במקום אשר נגע בו דודי כששלח ידו מן החור נתבשמו ידי
וקבלו מן הריח שהיה בידי דודי עד שעבור‎</span> Lovers, in ancient times, whilst suing for admission, used to ornament the door with
wreaths, and perfume it with aromatics. Thus Lucretius, iv. 1171,

</div>
<p class="first">Comp. also Tibul. i. 2, 14. So Herder, Kleuker, Ewald, Döpke, Rosenmüller, Philippson,
&amp;c.; Rashbam however is of opinion that the liquid myrrh which distilled from the
Shulamite’s hand, was the perfume with which she had anointed herself after washing.
Whilst Percy supposes that “she got up in such haste, that she spilt upon her hand
the vessel of liquid myrrh, which she had brought to anoint and refresh his head,
after having been exposed to the inclemencies of the night.<span class="corr" id="xd31e11048" title="Not in source">”</span> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מוֹר עֹבֵר‎</span>, <i>liquid myrrh</i>, see i. 2; and not, as Le Clerc <span class="corr" id="xd31e11055" title="Source: eroneously">erroneously</span> supposes, <i>current myrrh</i>, that kind of myrrh which is most passable in traffic. The Vulg. has, <i lang="la">Et digiti mei pleni myrrha probatissima</i>, evidently mistaking the prep. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עַל‎</span> for <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מָלְאוּ‎</span>, and takes the words <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כַּפּוֹת הַמַּנְעוּל‎</span> over to the following verse, <i lang="la">Pessulum ostii mei aperui dilecto meo.</i>
</p>
<p><a href="#v5.6">6</a>. <i>My beloved had withdrawn</i>, &amp;c. To her great grief she found, when opening, that her beloved had gone. The asyndeton
<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חָמַק עָבַר‎</span> is very expressive, and the use of the two synonymous terms strengthens the sense.
This figure, which is effected by the omission of the <i>conjunctive</i> particle, is used in animated descriptions, both by sacred and profane writers. Comp.
<span class="trans" title="Siōpa, pephimōso"><span lang="grc" class="grek">Σιώπα, πεφίμωσο</span></span>, Mark iv, 39. Winer, New Testament Gram. § 66, 4. The phrase <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יָצָא נֶפֶשׁ‎</span>, properly denoting the departure of the soul from the body, (Gesen. xxxv. 18; Ps.
cxlvi. 4,) like <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יָצָא לֵב‎</span>, is used to express <i>the momentary loss of the senses</i>, i.e. <i>to faint</i>. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בְּדַבְּרוֹ‎</span>, <i>in his speaking</i>, i.e. when he had spoken of it, (Judg. viii. 3; 1 Sam. xvii. 28), <i>i.e.</i> of his going away: so Rashi, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שאמר לא אבא אל ביתך כי מתחילה לא אבית לפתוח‎</span>, “Because he said I will not now enter thy house, for thou didst at first refuse
to open me,” and Immanuel, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נפשי יצאה בדברו אלי הנני הולך לדרכי אחרי שלא תפתחתי הדלת‎</span>. “My soul departed when he told me, Now I am going away, because thou wouldst not
open me the door.” We must employ a finite verb with a conjunction to express in English
the Hebrew construction of the infinitive with a preposition, and the relation of
time must be gathered from the connection, Gesen. § 132, 2, 3.
</p>
<p><a href="#v5.7">7</a>. <i>The watchmen who patrol the city</i>, &amp;c. That the seeking and calling mentioned in the last verse were not confined to
the door, is evident from this verse. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פְצָעוּנִי‎</span>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הִכּוּנִי‎</span> are again an asyndeton. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רָדִיד‎</span>, which occurs only once more, Is. iii. 23, is a kind of <i>veil-garment</i>, which Oriental ladies still wear, and denotes more properly an out-door <span class="pageNum" id="pb167n">[<a href="#pb167n">167</a>]</span>cloak. See Schroeder, Vestit. Mul. p. 368; Gesen. on Isa. iii. 23; Winer, Bib. Dict.
s.v.; Saalschütz, <span lang="de"><span class="corr" id="xd31e11141" title="Source: Archaëologie">Archäologie</span> der Hebräer</span>, vol. i. p. 28.
</p>
<p><a href="#v5.8">8</a>. <i>I adjure you</i>, &amp;c. Having mentioned the indifference with which she had treated her beloved, the
Shulamite is anxious to impress upon the court-ladies that this was in a dream, and
that in reality, so far from her affections being abated, she was as dotingly attached
to him as ever; and begs of them, if they should see him, to tell him so. For the
masculine termination in <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תִּמְצְאוּ אֶתְכֶם‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תַּגִּידוּ‎</span>, see ii. 7. We must supply <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הַגִּידוּ לוֹ‎</span>, <i>tell him</i>, after <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מַה תַּגִּיודוּ לוֹ‎</span>, <i>what will you tell him?</i> The omission is designedly made, to give animation to the request. The emendation
proposed by Houbigant, to read <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הגידנו‎</span>, instead of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חגידו‎</span>, is gratuitous, like all his emendations. The Sept. adds <span class="trans" title="en tais dynamesin kai en tais ischysesin tou agrou"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ἐν ταῖς δυνάμεσιν καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἰσχύσεσιν τοῦ ἀγροῦ</span></span>, “by the powers, and by the virtues of the field,” the false rendering of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בִּצְבָאוֹת אוֹ בְּאַיְלוֹת הַשָּׂדֶה‎</span>, from the preceding formula of adjuration.
</p>
<p><a href="#v5.9">9</a>. <i>What is thy beloved</i>, &amp;c. The great solicitude manifested by the Shulamite for her beloved, induces the
court ladies to ask what peculiar attractions there were in him more than in an ordinary
lover, to cause such an unusual manifestation of feeling, and thus an opportunity
is afforded her to give a description of him. It is evident from this question of
the court ladies that Solomon is not the beloved of whom the Shulamite has been speaking
in the preceding verses. For surely these court ladies knew the aspect and character
of Solomon better than the Shulamite. This is, moreover, established beyond doubt
from ch. vi. 2, 3, where the damsel, at the end of the description, designedly states
that the object of her delineation and attachment, is the shepherd. The particle <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מִן‎</span>, prefixed to <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דוֹד‎</span>, with which the comparison is made, expresses the comparative, Gesen. § 191, 1. For
<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הַיָּפָה בַּנָּשִׁים‎</span>, see i. 8, and for the form <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הִשְׁבַּעְתָּנוּ‎</span>, Ewald, § 249, d.
</p>
<p><a href="#v5.10">10</a>. <i>My beloved is white</i>, &amp;c. The Shulamite answers this question by giving a very graphic description of
her beloved. The colour of his countenance and body is such a beautiful mingling of
white and red as is seldom seen, and by which he is distinguished above thousands.
A similar description is found in Virg. Æn. xii. 65, seq.

</p>
<p><a href="#v5.11">11</a>. <i>His head is as pure gold.</i> That is of consummate excellency. Having characterized his whole person as charming,
the Shulamite describes the beauty of the individual parts of his body, and begins
with his head. Gold is frequently used, both in Scripture and in profane writers,
to denote <i>consummate excellency</i> and <i>beauty</i>. Thus the illustrious personages are called gold and fine gold in Lam. iv. 1; and
Theocritus (Idyl. iii. 28.) calls the beautiful Helen <i>golden</i>. The words <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כֶּתֶם פָּז‎</span> are variously rendered. The Sept. has <span class="trans" title="chrysiou kaiphaz"><span lang="grc" class="grek">χρυσίου καιφάζ</span></span>, <i>gold of</i> Cephaz, Aquila and Sym. <span class="trans" title="lithea tou chrysiou"><span lang="grc" class="grek">λίθεα τοῦ <span class="corr" id="xd31e11311" title="Source: χρυσίοῦ">χρυσίου</span></span></span>, so the Syriac <span lang="syc" class="syrc">ܒܐܦܷܐ ܕܕܰܗܒܳܐ‎</span>, <i>a precious stone of gold</i>. The Chald. has <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דְהַב טָב‎</span>; so the Vulg. <i lang="la">aurum optimum</i>. The Rabbins too vary in their explanations of these words. Ibn Ezra takes <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כֶּתֶם‎</span> to be <i>a diadem</i>, and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פָּז‎</span>, <i>precious stones</i>. Rashi indefinitely <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏סגולת מלכים‎</span>, <i>choice things, which kings treasure up</i>. Rashbam explains <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כָּתֶם‎</span> by <i>a heap of gold</i>, and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פָּז‎</span> by <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏זהב מופז‎</span>, and says it is called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פָּז‎</span>, “because its colour is like pearl.” The majority of modern commentators, after the
Sept., Vulg., Chald., take <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כֶּתֶם‎</span> as a poetical expression for <i>gold</i>, and derive it from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כָּתַם‎</span>, <i>to hide</i>, <i>to conceal</i>; like <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏סְגוֹר‎</span>, <i>gold</i> (Job. xxviii. 15), from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏סָגַר‎</span>, <i>to shut up</i>, <i>to conceal</i>, because precious metals are generally kept shut up or concealed. This meaning and
derivation of the word are supported by the fact that treasures and precious things
are generally expressed in Hebrew by words whose roots signify to <i>conceal</i>; comp. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אוֹצָר‎</span>, <i>a treasure</i> (1 Kings vii. 51; xiv. 26), from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אָצַר‎</span>, <i>to shut up</i>; <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מַטְמוֹן‎</span>, <i>a treasure</i>, <i>gold</i> (Isa. liv. 2; Prov. ii. 4), from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏טָמַן‎</span>, <i>to hide</i>; <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צָפוּן‎</span>, <i>riches</i> (Job xx. 26), from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צָפַן‎</span>, <i>to conceal</i>. As for <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פָּז‎</span>, it is translated by some <i>purified</i>, <i>pure</i>, from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פָּזַז‎</span>, <i>to separate</i>, <i>to purify</i> (Gesenius, &amp;c.); and by others <i>solid</i>, <i>massy</i>, from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פָּזַז‎</span>, <i>to be strong</i>, <i>solid</i> (Rosenmüller, &amp;c.). But <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פָּז‎</span> never occurs as an adjective to <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כֶּתֶם‎</span>, or to <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏זָהָב‎</span> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏זָהָב מוּפָז‎</span>, 1 Kings x. 18, is a contraction of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏זָהָב מְאוּפָז‎</span>, comp. Jer. x. 9); the word itself invariably means <i>gold</i> (see Job xxvii. 17; Ps. xix. 11; xxi. 4; cxix. 27; Prov. viii. 19; Cant. v. 15; Isa.
xiii. 12; Lam. iv. 2.); and accordingly ought to be rendered so here: “thy head is
as gold, gold.” As this, however, would produce tautology, it is therefore best to
take <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פָּז‎</span> as a contraction of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אוּפָז‎</span> (a variation of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אוֹפּיר‎</span>; see Gesenius, s.v.; Henderson on Jer. x. 9, and Stuart on Dan. x. 5), with which
this word goes together, 1 Kings x. 18; Jer. x. 9; Dan. x. 5. As <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אוּפָן‎</span> = <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כֶּתֶם אוֹפִיר‎</span>, is regarded as the best gold; hence the rendering of the Vulg. <i lang="la">aurum optimum</i>, and Chald. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דְהַב טָב‎</span>.

<p><a href="#v5.12">12</a>. <i>His eyes, like doves</i>, &amp;c. The vivid and black pupils of his eyes, sparkling forth from the encircling
lactean white, in which they are, as it were, bathing and sitting on the fountain
of tears, resemble doves bathing gaily in pellucid streams. The doves themselves,
and not their eyes, are the point of comparison (<span lang="la">vide supra</span>, i. 15, and iv. 1.) Doves are very fond of bathing, and hence choose for their abode
regions abounding with streams (Boch. Hieroz. ii. 1, c. 2.) The deep blue or grey
dove, reflecting the lustrous dark hue about its neck when bathing in the limpid brook,
suggested this beautiful simile. A similar figure occurs in the Gitagovinda: “The
glances of her eyes played like <i>a pair of water-birds of azure plumage</i>, that sport near a full-blown lotos in a pool in the season of dew.” The words <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רֹחֲצוֹת בֶּחָלָב‎</span>, <i>bathing in milk</i>, referring to the eyes, are descriptive of the milky white in which the black pupils
of the eyes are, as it were, bathing. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עַל מִלֵּאת‎</span>, <i>on the fulness</i>, also referring to the eyes, correspond to the <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עַל אֲפִיקֵי מַיִם‎</span>, <i>by the brooks of water</i>, which are predicated of the doves. Hodgson’s rendering of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏<span class="corr" id="xd31e11575" title="Source: ישְׁבוֹת">יֹשְׁבוֹת</span> עַל מִלֵּאת‎</span>, by “<i>and dwell among the ripe corn</i>,” is absurd.
</p>
<p><a href="#v5.13">13</a>. <i>His cheeks are like beds of balsam</i>, &amp;c. His round cheeks with the pullulating beard, resemble beds growing aromatic
plants. The Sept., Arabic, Æth., Chald., read <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מְגַדִּלוֹת‎</span>, the part. Piel, instead of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מִגְדְּלוֹת‎</span>, which many modern commentators follow, but without MS. authority. The lily here
referred to is most probably the <i>crown imperial</i>, of a deep red colour, whose leaves contain an aqueous humidity, which gathers itself
in the form of pearls, especially at noon, and distils clear and pellucid drops; see
Rosenmüller, Alther, iv. 138; Winer, Bib. Dict. s.v. There is, however, no necessity
for referring the words “distilling liquid myrrh,” to the lilies. Indeed, it seems
to be more consonant with the context, to take them as predicated of the lips, expressing
the sweetness of his conversation. Comp. iv. 11.
</p>
<p><a href="#v5.14">14</a>. <i>His hands are like</i>, &amp;c. His rounded arms and fingers tipped with well-shaped nails, as if inlaid with
precious stones, resemble golden cylinders: and his white and smooth body, covered
with a delicate blue vest, resembles polished ivory. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גָּלִיל‎</span> (from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גָּלַל‎</span>, <i>to roll</i>), <i>a roller</i>, <i>a cylinder</i>. Kleuker, Gesenius, Döpke, &amp;c., translate <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יָדָיו <span class="corr" id="xd31e11617" title="Source: גְּלִילַי">גְּלִילֵי</span> זָהָב <abbr title="וְגֹומֵר">וגו״</abbr>‎</span>, <i>his hands are like golden rings, adorned with gems of Tarshish</i>, comparing the hand when closed or bent to a golden ring, and the dyed nails to the
gems in the rings. But <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גָּלִיל‎</span> never occurs in the sense of a ring worn on the finger; the word so used is <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏טַבַּעַת‎</span>, which would have been used here had the figure meant what Kleuker, &amp;c. understood
by it. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תַּרְשִׁישׁ‎</span>, according to the Sept., Aquila, Josephus, and modern writers, is the chrysolite,
and owes its Hebrew name to the circumstance that it was first found in Tartessus,
that ancient city in Spain, between the two mouths of the river <span class="corr" id="xd31e11638" title="Source: Bactis">Baetis</span> (Guadalquiver). The chrysolite, as its name imports <span class="pageNum" id="pb170n">[<a href="#pb170n">170</a>]</span>(<span class="trans" title="chrysos"><span lang="grc" class="grek"><span class="corr" id="xd31e11646" title="Source: χρύσος">χρυσός</span></span></span>, <i>gold</i>, and <span class="trans" title="lithos"><span lang="grc" class="grek">λίθος</span></span>, <i>a stone</i>), is of a yellow or gold colour, and pellucid. Being of a glass lustre, the chrysolite
is beautifully chosen to represent the nails. The words <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מְמֻלָּאִים בַּתַּרְשִׁישׁ‎</span> refer to <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יָדָיו‎</span>. The expression <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מֵעִים‎</span>, prop. <i>the internal parts</i> of the human frame (v. 4), is here used for the <i>external</i> = the body; so Dan. ii. 32. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עֶשֶׁת‎</span> is taken by most modern commentators to denote <i>something fabricated</i>, or <i>wrought</i>; an <i>artificial work</i>; thus deducing this sense from the secondary meaning of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עָשַׁת‎</span>, which the Syriac (<span lang="syc" class="syrc">ܥܰܒܕܳܐ‎</span>, <i>work</i>,) seems to favour; but this is incompatible with the description here given of the
beloved. The Shulamite, throughout the whole of this delineation, depicts the splendour
and colour of the body as they dazzle <i>the eye</i>, but makes no reference to the wondrous construction of the frame, which could have
been discerned only by the exercise of the <i>intellect</i>. It is therefore better, with Ibn Ezra, Kimchi, Rashi, Rashbam, Luther, Auth. Version,
Mendelssohn, Kleuker, Williams, Good, Hengstenberg, &amp;c. to take <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עֶשֶׁת‎</span>, from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עָשַׁת‎</span>, in its primary meaning, <i>to shine</i>, <i>to be bright</i>, in the sense of <i>brightness</i>, <i>polish</i>; comp. Jer. v. 28.
</p>
<p><i>Covered with sapphires.</i> These words refer to his body, and describe the purple tunic covering the snowy white
skin. Good, Meier, &amp;c. take it to describe the blue veins which were seen through
his clear snowy skin, like a sapphire stone through a thin transparent plate of ivory.
But this is against the meaning of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מְעֻלֶּפֶת‎</span>, which signifies <i>covered</i>, and not <i>inlaid</i>; the external covering, and not the internal seen through the outer cover. Commentators
are not agreed whether that which we call the genuine sapphire, a transparent stone
of a beautiful sky-blue colour, in hardness and value next to the diamond, is meant
by <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏סַפִּיר‎</span>; or the sapphire of the ancients, which, according to Pliny, (Hist. Nat. xxxvii.
39; Theophrast. De Lapid. 231,) is a stone of a pure blue colour, and has frequently
pebble spots of a golden yellow hue, which were formerly thought to be really gold,
and is evidently our lapis lazuli, lazure-stone. As the latter does neither suit Job
xxviii. 6, for the lazure-stone is not very precious; nor Exod. xxviii. 18, since
it is too soft to bear engraving, it is more probable that the real sapphire is meant
by <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏סַפִּיר‎</span> in the Scriptures. This stone is often found in collections of ancient gems; see
Rosenmüller, Bib. Bot. and Miner.; Kitto, Cyclop. Bib. Lit. s.v. The Syriac, which
translates <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מְעֻלֶּפֶת <span class="corr" id="xd31e11739" title="Source: סַפִירים">סַפִּירִים</span>‎</span> by <span lang="syc" class="syrc">ܥܰܠ ܡܰܦܚܳܐ ܣܦܻܝܐܳܐ‎</span>, <i>upon the sapphire breathing</i>, must have had another reading.
</p>
<p><a href="#v5.15">15</a>. <i>His legs are like pillars of marble</i>, &amp;c. His white legs, standing upon beautiful feet, resemble the purest marble columns
based upon golden pedestals. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שׁוֹק‎</span>, as Kimchi well explains it, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מה שהוא על הרגל חליל ויגיע עד הברכים‎</span>, is that part of the limb from the knee to the foot. That <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אַדְנֵי פָז‎</span> refers to his feet (Ibn Ezra, Rashbam, Kleuker, Meier, Hitzig, &amp;c.), and not to his
sandals (Good, Williams, &amp;c.), is evident from ver. 11 and 14, where the head and
the hands, the visible parts of the body, are described as golden; and it is but natural
that the feet, the only remaining exposed parts, should also be described as golden.
</p>
<p><i>His aspect is like that of Lebanon.</i> Having depicted the single parts of his body, the Shulamite now joins them together,
and presents them in one whole, the appearance of which impresses the mind with a
sense of beauty and majesty, like that of Lebanon. “That goodly mountain, <span class="pageNum" id="pb171n">[<a href="#pb171n">171</a>]</span>even Lebanon” (Deut. iii. 25), being so luxuriant in its vegetation and rich in scenery,
appeared very beautiful and majestic at a distance. “Lebanon is a noble range of mountains,
well worthy of the fame it has so long maintained. It is cultivated in a wonderful
manner, by the help of terraces, and is still very fertile. We saw on some of its
eminences, more than 2,000 feet high, villages and luxuriant vegetation; and on some
of its peaks, 6,000 feet high, we could discern tall pines against the clear sky beyond.
At first the clouds were on the lofty summit of the range, but they cleared away,
and we saw Tannin, which is generally regarded as the highest peak of Lebanon. There
is a deep ravine that seems to run up the whole way, and Tannin rises to the height
of 10,000 feet. The rays of the setting sun gave a splendid tint to the lofty brow
of the mountain.”—Mission of Inquiry to the Jews, p. 240, &amp;c.; comp. also Isa. xxxv.
2; Rosenmüller, Alterth. i. 2. p. 239; Volney, Travels, i. 293.
</p>
<p><i>He is distinguished as the cedars</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, in his stature. The lofty cedar, towering above all other trees, is easily distinguished
from the rest (Ezek. xxxi. 3–16; Amos ii. 9). A similar comparison occurs in Theocritus,
xviii. 30, as quoted above, i. 9. The Chald., Ewald, Magnus, Philippson, &amp;c., take
<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏<span class="corr" id="xd31e11776" title="Source: בַּהוּר">בַּחוּר</span>‎</span> for <i>young man</i>, <i>youth</i>; comp. Ruth iii. 10; Isa. lxii. 5, “A young man like the cedars;” but the point of
comparison is lost in this case. Besides, we should then expect the sing. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֶרֶז‎</span>, and not the plur. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֲרָזִים‎</span>. Moreover, 2 Kings xix. 23, and Jer. xxii. 7, where the same phrase <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מִבְחַר אֲרָזִים‎</span> is used, is against it.
</p>
<p><a href="#v5.16">16</a>. <i>His voice is exquisitely sweet</i>, &amp;c. The members, after being analysed separately, have been viewed as a whole; but
the beautiful person thus described is inanimate, like the splendid marble columns
or the lofty cedars, to which she had compared him. In this verse the Shulamite represents
the charms of his speech; and thus affirms his whole person, bodily and mentally,
as most lovely. “Such,” she triumphantly exclaims, “is my friend; and now, ye daughters
of Jerusalem, judge for yourselves wherein my beloved is more than another beloved.”
<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חֵךְ‎</span>, prop. <i>palate</i>, is used for <i>the organ of speech</i>, and <i>speech</i> itself, Job vi. 30; xxxi. 10; Prov. v. 3. That <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חֵךְ‎</span> here does not mean any part of the body, is evident from the context; for it would
be preposterous to recur to the <i>palate</i> or <i>mouth</i> after the whole person had been described. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מַמְתַּקִּים‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מַחֲמַדִּים‎</span> are <i>abstracts</i> (see i. 2), <i>adjectively</i> used (Gesen. § 106, 1, Rem. 1), to give intensity to the idea; comp. Gen. i. 2. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כֻּלּוֹ‎</span>, <i>his whole person</i>, bodily and mentally.
</p>
<p><a href="#v6.1">1</a>. <i>Whither is thy beloved gone</i>, &amp;c.? The court ladies, moved by this charming description, inquire of the Shulamite
what direction he took, and offer to seek him. The word <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הַגִּדִי‎</span> is omitted after <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דֹודֵךְ‎</span>, for the sake of brevity and pathos. For the superlative force of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הַיָפָה בַּנָּשִׁים‎</span>, <span lang="la">vide supra</span>, i. 8.

<p><a href="#v6.2">2</a>, <a href="#v6.3">3</a>. <i>My beloved is gone down into his garden</i>, &amp;c. The Shulamite, knowing that the court ladies are anxious to induce her to transfer
her affections to the king, replies in a vague manner, that he is gone to his garden,
he is not lost, nor has her affection to him abated, though they are now separated,
nor does she fear that his love for her is diminished. This incontestably proves that
the object of the damsel’s affection, of whom she gave a description in the preceding,
is not the king, but, as she herself tells us here most unequivocally, a shepherd.
For ver. 3, comp. chap. ii. 16.
</p>
<p><a href="#v6.4">4</a>. <i>Graceful art thou, O my love</i>, &amp;c. Just as before (i. 9), Solomon made his appearance as soon as the Shulamite
inquired after her beloved, so here he comes forward again when she speaks of her
absent lover; thus endeavouring to show his own attachment to her. He addresses her,
as before, in the most flattering terms: “Thou art as graceful as the delectable Tirzah,
as charming as the delightful Jerusalem, as striking and conquering as an imposing
army in full battle array.” Tirzah was the royal residence of the kings of Israel
after the revolt of Rehoboam, and retained that distinction till the time of Omri,
who built Samaria (1 Kings x. 15–21; xvi. 14; 2 Kings xv. 4). It was a city of fascinating
appearance, as its name, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תִּרְצָה‎</span>, <i>delightful</i>, indicates; and hence yielded a very flattering comparison. The Sept. takes <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תִּרְצָה‎</span> as an appellative, <span class="trans" title="hōs eudokia"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ὡς εὐδοκία</span></span>; so Aquila, <span class="trans" title="kat’ eudokian"><span lang="grc" class="grek">κατ’ εὐδοκίαν</span></span>, Sym. <span class="trans" title="eudokētē"><span lang="grc" class="grek">εὐδοκήτη</span></span>, Syriac, <span lang="syc" class="syrc">ܐܝܰܟ ܨܶܒܝܳܢܳܐ‎</span> The Chald. paraphrases it <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בִּזְמַן דצְבוּתֵךְ‎</span>, <i>in the time of thy willingness</i>, and Rashi inclines to it; the Vulg. has <i lang="la">suavis et decora</i>. But there can be no doubt, as Ibn Ezra, Rashbam, and all modern commentators take
it, that it is a proper name, Tirzah, the capital of Jeroboam’s kingdom. It may be
that the ancient versions resorted to the expediency of taking <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תִּרְצָה‎</span> as an appellative, because they wished to avoid the contrast of the two capitals,
since this would speak against Solomon being the author of this book. Jerusalem, “the
perfection of beauty” (Lam. ii. 15), afforded another excellent figure.
</p>
<p><i>Awe-inspiring as bannered hosts!</i> The fascinating power of a woman is frequently compared to the prowess of an armed
host. Comp. Prov. vii. 26. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אָיוֹם‎</span>, which occurs once more in connexion with <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נוֹרָא‎</span>, Hab. i. 7, means <i>awful</i>, <i>awe-inspiring</i>, <i>imposing</i>. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נִדְגָּלוֹת‎</span>, Niph. part. prop. <i>bannered</i>, <i>people furnished</i>, or <i>arrayed with banners</i>, hence <i>armies</i>, <i>hosts</i>. The feminine is here used to express a collective idea; comp. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֹרְחוֹת‎</span>, <i>caravans</i>, Isa. xxi. 13; Gesen. § 107, 3 d; Ewald, § 179 c.
</p>
<p><a href="#v6.5">5</a>. <i>Turn away thine eyes from me</i>, &amp;c. These awe-inspiring hosts are described as concentrated in her eyes, which <span class="pageNum" id="pb173n">[<a href="#pb173n">173</a>]</span>Solomon implores the Shulamite to remove from him. “The artillery of the eyes,” says
Dr. Good, <i lang="la">in loco</i>, “is an idea common to poets of every nation.” Thus Anacreon, xvi.

1–3, where the same description is given, with the exception that there <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קְצוּבוֹת‎</span> is used for sheep, and here <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רְחֵלִים‎</span>, and that the first half of ver. 3 is here omitted in the Hebrew, which is here given
by the Sept. We cannot refrain from quoting the beautiful explanation of these figures
from the manuscript commentary of Immanuel: <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תלתלי שערך ושורותיו נופלים זה על זה לדמיון עדר העזים שהם נתלים זה על זה בהרים <span id="xd31e12110"></span>ושניך הﬦ לבניﬦ ושויﬦ לדמיון עדר הרחליﬦ<span class="corr" id="xd31e12114" title="Not in source">,</span> שצמדם לבן והם עולים מן הרחצה שכלם מתאימות שב אל שניה שהם שוות, ושכולה אין בהם שאין

</p>
<p><a href="#v6.8">8</a>, <a href="#v6.9">9</a>. <i>I have threescore queens</i>, &amp;c. The flattery and praise here exceed all that have been previously offered. Solomon
protests that, though he is surrounded by a numerous retinue of women of all ranks,
the Shulamite is the sole possessor of his heart: she who is the <span class="pageNum" id="pb174n">[<a href="#pb174n">174</a>]</span>best beloved of her mother, and whose consummate beauty has elicited the highest praises
from the queens, concubines and maidens. The discrepancy between the number of Solomon’s
wives and concubines here stated, and that described in 1 Kings xi. 3, maybe reconciled
by taking <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שִׁשִׁים‎</span>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שְׁמֹנִים‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֵין מִסְפָּר‎</span> for indefinite and large numbers: <i>many</i>, <i>very many</i>, <i>without number</i>: so Kleuker, Rosenmüller, Magnus, &amp;c. “We must supply <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לִי‎</span>, <i>to me</i>, after <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הֵמָּה‎</span>, <i>there</i>. For <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הֵמָּה‎</span>, <i>mas</i>, instead of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הֵנָּה‎</span>, <i>fem.</i>, see ii. 7. The pronoun <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הִיא‎</span>, <i>she</i>, is the subject in all the three clauses, and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אַחַת‎</span> in the first and second clause, and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בַּרָה‎</span> in the third are predicates. We must supply <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לִי‎</span> after <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אַחַת הִיא‎</span>, <i>she is my only one</i>; just as <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אַחַת הִיא לְאִמָּה‎</span>. The word <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֶחָד‎</span> is used for <i>the only one</i> of its kind (Job xxiii. 13; Ezek. ii. 64; vii. 5), <i>favourite</i>; comp. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גּוֹי אֶחָד בָּאָרֶץ‎</span>, 2 Sam. vii. 23.
</p>
<p><a href="#v6.10">10</a>. <i>Who is she that looks forth</i>, &amp;c. That Solomon quotes here the eulogy mentioned in the preceding verse, which
the court ladies pronounced upon the superlative beauty of the Shulamite when they
first beheld her, has long been recognised by the Rabbins, and is now admitted by
most interpreters. This is, moreover, confirmed by Prov. xxxi. 28, where the same
words, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אִשֵּׁר‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הַלֵּל‎</span>, are used, and the following verse contains the eulogy which the husband utters.
The rising morning, with its red light looking down from heaven over the mountains
(Joel ii. 2); the beautiful and placid complexion of the moon, and the refulgent and
resplendent appearance of the sun, have often afforded, both to the Oriental and to
the Greek and Latin writers, exquisite similes for beauty and grandeur. Thus Sirach
(l. 5, 6), describing the High Priest, says:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“How splendid he was in his interview with the people. </p>
<p class="line">In his coming out from the house of the veil! </p>
<p class="line">As the morning star amid the clouds, </p>
<p class="line">As the moon when full in her days, </p>
<p class="line">As the sun when beaming upon the temple of the Most High.” </p>
</div>
<p class="first">Comp. also Rev. i. 16; Theocritus’ description of Helen, xviii. 26–28; Lane’s Arabian

</p>
<p>11, 12. <i>I went down into the nut-garden</i>, &amp;c. As Solomon had referred, in uttering his encomium, to her first coming within
sight of the court ladies, the Shulamite here instantly interrupts the king, in order
to explain how that came to pass. “I did not go to meet the king, to exhibit myself
and be admired by him or his royal retinue; I merely went into the garden with the
intention of seeing whether there were any herbs to take home for use, and whether
the fruit promised well; and this (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נַפְשִׁי‎</span>) <i>intention</i> of mine brought me unawares near the monarch and his cortége.” Though <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֱגוֹז‎</span>, <i>nut-tree</i>, (so Sept., Vulg., Chald.,) <i>nut</i> occurs nowhere else in the Old Testament, yet its meaning is established from the
cognate languages, and its frequent usage in the Talmud and latter Hebrew writers,
<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רָאָה ב‎</span>, <i>to look among</i> (Gen. xxxiv.), with the intention of <i>choosing</i> <span class="pageNum" id="pb175n">[<a href="#pb175n">175</a>]</span>that which pleases, Gen. vi. 2. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏<span class="corr" id="xd31e12275" title="Source: אֲבִי">אִבֵּי</span> הַנָּחַל‎</span>, <i>the green</i> or <i>vegetables growing by the river side</i>; so the Sept. <span class="trans" title="genēmati tou cheimarrhou"><span lang="grc" class="grek">γενήματι τοῦ χειμάῤῥου</span></span>, and Rashbam, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏על שפת הנחל‎</span>. The Sept. has here <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שָׁם אֶתֵּן אֶת דּוֹדַי לָךְ‎</span>, from chap. vii. 14, which the Arabic, <span class="corr" id="xd31e12299" title="Source: Ethiopic">Æthiopic</span>, and several modern commentators wrongly follow, as it has no MS. authority, and
has evidently arisen from a misunderstanding of this passage.
</p>
<p><a href="#v6.12">12</a>. <i>Unwittingly</i>, &amp;c. This verse has caused much perplexity to interpreters. The ancient versions,
finding the sense obscure, have altered almost every word, and hence increased the
difficulty. Thus the Sept. has <span class="trans" title="ouk egnō hē psychē mou; etheto me harmata Aminadab"><span lang="grc" class="grek">οὐκ ἔγνω ἡ ψυχή μου· ἔθετό με ἅρματα Ἀμιναδάβ</span></span>, which Luther follows: “<i lang="de">Meine Seele wusste es nicht, dass er mich zum Wagen Aminadib gezetzt hatte</i>:” They take <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נֶפֶשׁ‎</span> as the subject, alter <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לֹא יָדַעְתִּי‎</span>, the first person com., into <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לֹא יָדְעָה‎</span>, the third fem., to agree with <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נֶפֶשׁ‎</span>, a fem. noun, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שָׂמַתְנִי‎</span>, the third fem., into <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שַׂמְנִי‎</span>, the third masc. referring it to Solomon, and regard <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עַמִּי נָדִיב‎</span> as a proper name. The Vulg. has <i lang="la">Nescivi, anima mea conturbavit me propter quadrigas Aminadab</i>; altering <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שָׂמַתְנִי‎</span>, the Kal of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שׂוּם‎</span>, <i>to put</i>, <i>to place</i>, into the Hiphil of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שָׂמֵם‎</span>, <i>to be astonished</i>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מַרְכְּבוֹת‎</span> into <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מֵרִכְבוֹת‎</span>, the plural of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רֶכֶב‎</span>, with the preposition <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מ‎</span>, and taking <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עַמִּי נָדִיב‎</span> as a proper name. Passing over these textual alterations, and the emendations proposed
by modern commentators, as unauthorized, we shall first examine the words as they
are in the text, and then the most plausible interpretations deducible therefrom.
<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לֹא יָדַעְתִּי‎</span> are rightly taken by most, though differing in their opinion as to the rendering
of the remainder of the verse, as <i>adverbial</i>, in the sense of <i>suddenly</i>, <i>unwittingly</i>, and as subordinate to <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נַפְשִׁי שָׂמַתְנִי‎</span>, <i>my soul has unwittingly put me</i>, or <i>placed me</i>; comp. Job v. 9; Isa. xlvii. 11; Jer. l. 24. The verb <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שׂוּם‎</span>, <i>to put</i>, <i>to place</i>, may be construed with two accusatives, one of the person, and the other of the thing;
and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מַרְכְּבוֹת‎</span> may be taken as the <i>second accusative</i> (comp. Ps. xxxix. 9; 1 Sam. viii. 1; Mich. i. 7), or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מַרְכְּבוֹת‎</span> may be taken as a <i>designation of place</i> after <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שׂוּם‎</span>, a verb of motion; comp. Isa. xl. 26. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מֶרְכָּבָה‎</span>, <i>a chariot</i>, used for warlike purposes, or for state or pleasure, Gen. xlvi. 29; Exod. xv. 4;
2 Sam. xv. 1. The expression <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עַמִּי‎</span> may either mean <i>populares mei</i>—(the Hebrews having no separate word for “countryman,” use this expression to denote
one of their own people (Gesen. xxiii. 11; Lam. ii. 11), and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נָדִיב‎</span> may be an adjective for <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הַנַּדִיב‎</span>, as the article is sometimes omitted through following a noun with suffix)—or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עַמִּי‎</span> may here be used, like <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עִישׁ‎</span>, for <i>companions</i>, <i>attendants</i>, <i>followers</i>, (Eccl. iv. 16,) the <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏י‎</span> in <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עַמִּי‎</span> not being a suffix, but <i>paragogic</i>, and a mark of the const. state (Deut. xxxiii. 16; Lam. i. 1), and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נָדִיב‎</span>, a noun in the genitive of the king or prince. As to how much stress there is to
be laid on the Sept., which takes <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עַמִּי נָדִיב‎</span> as <i>a proper name</i>, and is followed by the Arabic, Æthiop., Vulg., and which also produced some variations
in the orthography of these words, we need only refer to vii. 2, where the same version
renders <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בַּת נָדִיב‎</span> by <span class="trans" title="thygatēr Aminadab"><span lang="grc" class="grek"><span class="corr" id="xd31e12468" title="Source: θύγαθηρ">θυγάτηρ</span> Ἀμιναδὰβ</span></span>. The verse, therefore, may either be translated: “<i>My soul has unwittingly made me the chariots of my noble countrymen</i>,” or, “<i>My soul has unwittingly placed at, or brought me to the chariots of my noble people</i>, or <i>to the chariots of the companions of the prince</i>.” Now against the first rendering we urge, in the first place, that if the chariots
be taken in the accusative, and hence in a figurative sense, we are unavoidably led
into a bewildering maze of conjectural and fanciful opinions. The following may serve
as a specimen. Rashi takes the chariots to be a sign of <i>ignominy</i>. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נפשי שמתני להיות מרכבות להרכיב עלי נדיבות שאר אומות‎</span>, “<i>My soul has made me to be chariots for foreign princes to ride upon</i>”; i.e. <i>I have willingly brought upon me a foreign yoke.</i> Ibn <span class="pageNum" id="pb176n">[<a href="#pb176n">176</a>]</span>Ezra takes the chariots as a figure for <i>swiftness</i>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לא ידעתי שהייתי הולכת במרוצה אליך כמו מרכבות עמי נדיב הגדול שיש בעמי‎</span>, “<i>I did not know that I was hurrying on to thee with the rapidity of the chariots of
the great prince who is among my people</i>;” which the Syriac, <span lang="syc" class="syrc">ܐܳܐ ܝܶܕܥܰܬ ܢܰܦܫܝ ܣܳܡܬܰܥܝ ܒܡܳܪܒܳܒܬܐ‎</span>, though sharing somewhat in the errors of the Sept. and Vulg., seems to favour. Herder
takes the chariots as a symbol of <i>martial power, guard, and protection</i> (Ps. xx. 8; 2 Kings ii. 11, 12). Hengstenberg affirms that the chariots signify <i>champion, guard, defence</i>. And secondly, this translation interrupts the connexion of this verse with the preceding
one. Now the second rendering avoids all this. Solomon has repeated in verse 10 the
praise which the court ladies had pronounced on the Shulamite when they first saw
her; the Shulamite (in ver. 11, 12), in reply, explains how she came to the carriages
of the court ladies.
</p>
<p><a href="#v7.1">1</a>. <i>Return, return</i>, &amp;c. Here we see how little all the persuasions, promises, and eulogies of the king
and courtiers affected the sincere and deeply rooted affections of the Shulamite for
her beloved shepherd. No sooner had she explained (as she incidentally informs us)
how she came to be noticed and taken up by the king, than she actually started off.
But the king entreated her to return, that he might look at her once more. The Shulamite,
pausing a little, turns round and modestly asks:
</p>
<p><i>What will you behold in the Shulamite?</i> That is, what can ye see in a humble rustic girl? <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הַשּׁוּלַמּית‎</span>, as is evident from the article, is a gentile noun, according to the analogy of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הַשּׁוּנַמִּית‎</span>, (1 Kings i. 3; 2 Kings iv. 12, 25.) Ewald, § 156<span class="corr" id="xd31e12527" title="Not in source"> </span>c: and a female inhabitant of Shulem, <i>i.q.</i> Shunem. Shulem still exists as a village, now called Sôlam, about three miles and
a half north of Zerîn, (Jezreel), and lies on the declivity, at the western end of
the mountain of Duhy, the so-called Little Hermon. “There is little room for doubt
that it is the ancient Shunem of the tribe of Issachar, where the Philistines encamped
before Saul’s last battle, (Josh. xix. 18; 1 Sam. xxviii. 4.) From the same place,
apparently, Abishag the Shunammite was brought to the aged David; and here it was
probably that Elisha often lodged in the house of the Shunammite woman, and afterwards
raised her son from the dead (1 Kings i. 3; 2 Kings iv. 8–37; viii. 1–6). Eusebius
and Jerome describe it in their day as a village lying five Roman miles from Mount
Tabor, towards the southern quarter, and they write the name already <i>Sulem</i>.” Robinson, Palestine, iii. 169, &amp;c. The transition of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ל‎</span> into <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נ‎</span> is of frequent occurrence; comp. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לָחַץ‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נָחַץ‎</span>, <i>to burn</i>. (Gesen. Lexicon, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ל‎</span> <i>a</i>; Ewald, § 156, c.) <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שׁוּלַמִּית‎</span> is not the feminine of the name <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שְׁלֹמֹה‎</span>, which would be <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שְׁלֹמִית‎</span>; comp. Lev. xxiv. 11; 1 Chron. iii. 19; Ewald, § 274, f.
</p>
<p><i>Like a dance to double choirs</i>, replies the king, <i>i.e.</i> “to see thee is like gazing at the charming view of a festive choir expressing their
merriment in a sacred dance. The Hebrews, in common with other nations (Strabo, 10),
used sacred dancing, accompanied by vocal and instrumental music, as expressive of
joy and rejoicing (Exod. xv. 20; 2 Sam. vi. 15; Ps. cxlix. 3). <span class="pageNum" id="pb177n">[<a href="#pb177n">177</a>]</span>A sight of such an assemblage of various beauties, all swelling their voices into
one song of joy, and blending their several forms in one choral dance of joy, must
have afforded a delightful picture. No wonder that such a scene is described by Homer
(Iliad, xviii. 590,) as portrayed on the famous shield of Achilles, and that
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“On either side spectators numerous stood, </p>

</div>
<p class="first">To this charming scene, therefore, does the captivated monarch compare the view of
the Shulamite. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מְחוֹלָה‎</span>, from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חוּל‎</span>, <i>to turn round</i>, <i>a dance</i>, the joyous dancing on a festive occasion. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ַחְנֶה‎</span>, prop. <i>a camp</i>, also <i>a multitude</i>, <i>a band of people</i>, Gen. l. 9. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מַחֲנַיִם‎</span> is the regular dual, and not the plural (Sept., Vulg., Gesenius, Döpke, &amp;c.), and
is here used because this dance consisted of a band arranged in a double line, something
like our country dance. On the different kinds of Oriental dances, see Rosenmüller,
Orient. ii. 19–22; Wilkinson, Manners, &amp;c., ii. 328–340. Saalschütz, <span lang="de"><span class="corr" id="xd31e12600" title="Source: Archäeologie">Archäologie</span> der <span class="corr" id="xd31e12603" title="Source: Hebraer">Hebräer</span></span>, vol. i. 302. The words <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כִּמְחֹלַת הַמַּחֲנַיִם‎</span> have elicited a variety of interpretations. Some take <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מַחֲנַיִם‎</span> as a <i>proper name</i>, and say that reference is here made to some particular mode of worship practised
in that place in consequence of Jacob’s sojourn there; but this is purely imaginary.
Others again suppose that an allusion is made to Gen. xxxii. 2, 3, and hence render
<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מַחֲנַיִם‎</span> by <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מַחֲנֵי אֱלֹהִים‎</span> or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צְבָאוֹת‎</span>; but this is unfounded, since we have not the slightest intimation in that passage
that the angels were engaged in dancing.
</p>
<p><a href="#v7.2">2</a>. <i>How beautiful are thy feet in sandals!</i> The Shulamite, in obedience to the king’s request, returns, and as she advances,
Solomon is arrested by her beautiful feet, with which he begins his last highly flattering
delineation of her beauty, and his last attempt to win her affections. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נְעָלִים‎</span>, Chald. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏סַנְדְלִין‎</span>, <i>sandals</i>, formed an important part of an Oriental costume (Ezek. xvi. 10; Judith xvi. 9).
The ladies bestowed great pains upon, and evinced much taste in ornamenting this article
of dress, which attracted the notice of the opposite sex. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בַּת נָדִיב‎</span> does not mean <i>a descendant of a titled family</i>, but, according to a common Hebrew idiom, which applies <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בַּת בֵּן‎</span>, and other terms of human kindred to relations of every kind, expresses that <i>she herself was of a noble character</i>. Comp. 1 Sam. i. 16; Gesen. § 106, 2 a; Ewald, § 287 f.
</p>
<p><i>The circuits of thy thighs like ornaments</i>, &amp;c. To describe the beautiful appearance of an object, the Orientals frequently
compared it to some precious metal or gem; see <span class="corr" id="xd31e12652" title="Source: supr.">supra,</span> v. 11; Prov. xxv. 12. The simple metal or gem, however, seems not to suffice here
to express the exquisite symmetry of these parts of the body; they are, therefore,
compared with some beautifully-wrought and highly-finished ornaments, formed of such
materials. The rendering of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פְּעָמִים‎</span> by <i>steps</i> (Sept., Vulg., Ewald, Döpke, Hengstenberg, &amp;c.), and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חַמוּקֵי‎</span> by <i lang="de">Schwingungen</i>, <i>movements</i> (Hengstenberg), is contrary to the scope of the description, which obviously depicts
the <i>several members</i> of the body (beginning with the feet and gradually ascending to the head), and not
their actions. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חֲלָאִים‎</span> is not the <i>dual</i> (Luther), but the <i>plural</i>; according to the analogy of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צְבִי‎</span>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צְבָאִים‎</span>; <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פְּתִי‎</span>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פְּתָאִים‎</span>. The <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏א‎</span> in the plural is preferred to the <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏י‎</span> in consequence of the preceding <span class="asc">A</span> sound. Gesen. § 93, 66; Ewald, § 186 e.
</p>
<p><a href="#v7.3">3</a>. <i>Thy navel is like a round goblet</i>, &amp;c. The reference and the import of the figure are obvious. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מֶזֶג‎</span>, <i>i.q.</i> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מֶסֶךְ‎</span>, <i>mixture</i>, <i>mixed wine</i>. The ancients were in the habit of mixing wine with spices, to make it more stimulating
and exciting. Wine thus mixed was called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יַיִן הַרֶקַח‎</span>, viii. <span class="pageNum" id="pb178n">[<a href="#pb178n">178</a>]</span>2, the <i lang="la">vinum aromatites</i> of the Greeks and Romans. (Comp. Ps. lxxv. 9; Prov. ix. 5; Isa. v. 22; Mishna, Maaser
sheni, ii. 1; Baba Mez. v. 2; Pliny, Hist. Nat. xiv. 15; Gesen. Thesaurus, p. 808;
Winer, Bib. Dict. s.v.) <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שָׁרְרֵךְ‎</span> is one of the few instances in which <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עע״‎</span> are resolved before suffixes, owing to the broadness of the vowels when preceding
<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ל‎</span>, or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ר‎</span>.

The particle <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אַל‎</span> expresses a subjective wish, Gesen. Lexicon, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אַל‎</span>, ii. 6, Ewald, § 320.
</p>
<p><i>Thy body is like a heap of wheat</i>, &amp;c. The point of analogy seems to subsist between the appearance of the body and
that of a quantity of corn heaped up, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עֲרַמָה‎</span>, which Ibn Ezra well explains <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עבה מלמטה ודקה מלמעלה‎</span>; so also Rashbam. Remembering that corpulency was deemed essential to an Eastern
beauty, this comparison will appear obvious. Selden, who is followed by others, takes
this passage as a prediction of the bride’s fertility: as:—“Wheat and barley were
among the ancient Hebrews emblems of fertility; and it was usual for standers-by to
scatter these grains upon the married couple, with a wish that they might increase
and multiply.” <span lang="la">Uxor Hebraica, lib. ii. cap. 15.</span> “A custom,” adds Williams, “which might probably originate from this passage, or
<i>vice versâ</i>.”
</p>
<p>But though it is true that it was a common practice among the Jews at marriages to
distribute among the company dried seeds (Talm. Chethuboth, ii. 1), probably to indicate
a wish that the newly-married couple might be fruitful, it does not follow that it
was the practice at so early an age, or that it is the meaning here. Were this the
sense here, we should expect that the Jewish commentators, who well knew and practised
the manners and customs of their own people, would have recognised it. Whereas, Rashi,
Rashbam, Ibn Ezra, &amp;c., explain this figure as referring to the appearance.
</p>
<p><i>Hedged round with</i>, &amp;c. The threshing-floors in ancient times were in the open air; and when the wheat
had been threshed out, fanned and heaped up, each heap was stuck round with thorns,
in order to keep off the cattle. (Hos. ii. 5, 6.) To render the figure more beautiful,
and the compliment more flattering, the enamoured king changes the hedge of thorns
into a fence of <i>lilies</i>. Others, however, refer these words to a robe embroidered with lilies, covering her
body; and others, again, to some ancient custom of surrounding or covering the newly-threshed
heap of wheat with a sort of garland of flowers, indicating the joy of the husbandman
at the return of the harvest.
</p>
<p><a href="#v7.4">4</a>, <a href="#v7.5">5</a>. <i>Thy bosom is like</i>, &amp;c. These verses, with a little variation arising from the fact that a different
person is the speaker here, contain the same figures as iv. 4, 5. The comparison between
the beautiful symmetry, erect bearing, and ivory colour of the neck, and between the
elegant structure, lofty altitude, and white colour of a tower, appears more striking
and apposite from the description given by Josephus of the towers of Jerusalem: “They
were so very tall, they appeared much taller by the place on which they stood; for
that very old wall, wherein they were, was built on a high hill, and was itself a
kind of elevation that was still thirty cubits taller, over which were the towers
situated, and thereby were made much higher to appearance. The largeness also of the
stones was wonderful; for they were not made of common small stones, nor of such large
ones only as men could carry, but they were of white marble, cut out of the rocks:
each stone was twenty cubits in length, and ten cubits in breadth, and five in depth.
They were so exactly united <span class="pageNum" id="pb179n">[<a href="#pb179n">179</a>]</span>to one another, that each tower looked like one entire block of stone, so growing
naturally, and afterwards cut by the hand of the artificer into the present shape
and corners; so little, or not at all, did their joints or connexion appear.” (Jewish
War, book v. chap. iv. 4.—Whiston’s translation.) The comparison of the neck with
ivory is also used by Anacreon (Ode xxix. 28, 29), in his description of Bathyllus:—

city. Heshbon, a town in the southern parts of the Hebrew territory, about twenty
miles east of the point where the Jordan enters the Dead Sea, originally belonged
to the Moabites (Numb. xxi. 25), and afterwards came into possession of the Amorite
king Sihon (ibid.; Deut. ii. 24; Josh. iii. 10). It was conquered by Moses shortly
before his death (Numb. xxi. 25), and was first assigned to the tribe of Reuben (Numb.
xxxii. 37; Josh. xiii. 17), and afterwards to the tribe of Gad, and became a Levitical
city (Josh. xxi. 39; 1 Chron. vi. 81). It was retaken by the Moabites when the ten
tribes were carried into exile (Isa. xv. 4; xvi. 9; Jer. xlviii. 2), but the Jews
conquered it again afterwards (Joseph. Antiq. lib. xiii.) The ruins of Heshbon, the
name by which the place is still known, have been visited and described by modern
travellers. (Burckhardt, Travels, p. 365; Biblical Repos. for 1833, p. 650; Robinson,
Palestine, ii. 278.) Heshbon was the pride of Moab, was famous for its fertility,
verdure of plantation, and beautiful reservoirs. Hence the simile here. A similar
comparison is used by Ovid, De Arte Ama. ii. 722:—

<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שהרבים באים להסתכל שם‎</span>, “because it is the chief place of concourse.” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בַּת‎</span>, <i>daughter</i>, like <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בֶּן‎</span>, <i>son</i>, is idiomatically used in Hebrew to express quality. Compare <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בֶּן־שֶׁמֶן‎</span>, <i>a son of fatness</i>, i.e. fat; Isa. v. 1, and supra, vii. 2. The Septuagint, which is followed by the
Vulgate, not understanding this idiom, renders it literally <span class="trans" title="en pylais thygatros pollōn"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ἐν πύλαις θυγατρὸς πολλῶν</span></span>, <i>by the gates of the daughter of many</i>.
</p>
<p><i>Thy nose</i>, &amp;c. This tower must have contained a projection or an overhanging part, celebrated
for its great symmetry and elegance. Hence the comparison between the beautifully
projecting tower and the well-proportioned nose.
</p>
<p><a href="#v7.6">6</a>. <i>Thy head upon thee</i>, &amp;c. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כַּרְמֶל‎</span> stands here for <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כַּרְמִיל‎</span>, <i>purpura</i>; so Ibn Gamach, Ibn Ezra, Fürst, &amp;c. This shell-fish is of a spiral form, and “the
exquisite juice which is so greatly sought after for the purpose of dyeing cloth is
situate in the middle of the throat. This secretion consists of a tiny drop contained
in a white vein, from which the precious liquid used for dyeing is distilled, being
of the tint of a rose, somewhat <i>inclined to black</i>.” Pliny, Hist. Nat. ix. 60, 61; Arist. Hist. Anim. lib. v. c. 14. The simile here
subsists between <i>the spiral form</i> of this shell-fish and <i>the pyramidal shape</i> in which the hair was anciently tied up on the top of the head. The Chinese and other
Eastern women still wear their hair rolled up into a knot or bunch at the top of the
head; and <span class="pageNum" id="pb180n">[<a href="#pb180n">180</a>]</span>even in this country ladies used to dress their hair in a somewhat similar manner.
The rendering of the ancient versions of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כַּרְמָל‎</span>, by <i>Mount Carmel</i>, which the majority of modern interpreters follow: they take the simile to be between
the beautiful appearance of the bride’s head and the charming, luxuriant, and picturesque
summit of this celebrated mountain; but this is against the <span class="corr" id="xd31e12892" title="Source: parallellism">parallelism</span> and 2 Chron. ii. 16, 13; iii. 14. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כַּרְמֶל‎</span> = <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כַּרְמִיל‎</span> is derived from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כָּרַם‎</span>, <i>to be shiningly red</i>, with <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏–ִיל‎</span> appended, according to the analogy of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פְּתִיגִיל‎</span>; vide Fürst, Lexicon <i>in voce</i>; or it may be that this shell-fish was so called because it was found on the shore
near Carmel. At all events, there is no need to look for the etymology of this word
out of the Shemitic family.
</p>
<p><i>And the tresses</i>, &amp;c. Fine hair is frequently compared by the Greeks and Romans with purple. Thus
Anacreon, xxviii. 11, 13.

<p><i>The king is captivated</i>, &amp;c. The ringlets, like the lashes of the eyelids, are frequently represented as
the net of love. Prov. vi. 25; Sirach ix. 3, 4. Thus Jami, in his Joseph and Zuleikha,
chap. i., as quoted by Dr. Good, says:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">

<p class="first"><span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מֶלֶךְ‎</span> stands for <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הַמֶּלֶךְ‎</span>; the article is not unfrequently omitted in poetry; comp. Ps. ii. 2; xxi. 2; Gesen.

&amp;c.), is against the punctuation and the evenness of the metre, interferes with the
interpretation of the remaining words, and has evidently arisen from a misunderstanding
of the passage. Besides, no people is known by such a name. It was owing to a feeling
of being consistent that the editor of Calmet felt himself constrained to take <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אַרְגָּמָן‎</span> as a proper name, <i>Argamen</i>, to correspond with the parallel <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כַּרְמֶל‎</span>; and to explain this clause as alluding to a particular mode of plaiting the hair,
like the weaving of <i>Arech</i>, a city in Babylonia, supposed to be famous for its weaving manufactories.
</p>
<p><i>How beautiful</i>, &amp;c. The captivated king, having described the beauty of the several parts of the
body, now combines the separate members into one lovely form, and endows it with life
and fascination, which none of the inanimate beauties to which he had compared her,
however admirable, possessed. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אַהֲבָה‎</span>, <i>love</i>, abstract for concrete, <i>loved one</i>, <span lang="la">vide supra</span>, chap. v. 1. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תַּעֲנוּג‎</span>, <i>charm</i>, <i>attraction</i>, such as living beings possess.

<p><a href="#v7.7">7</a>. <i>This thy growth</i>, &amp;c. The beautiful growth of the palm-tree, like that of the cedar and cypress, supplied
a forcible image to the ancients. <span class="pageNum" id="pb181n">[<a href="#pb181n">181</a>]</span>Thus the Son of Sirach, xxiv. 13, 14:—

proximity to <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תָּמָר‎</span>, <i>palm-tree</i>, dates are most probably intended. For the etymology of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֶשְׁכֹּל‎</span>, see supra, chap. i. 14; and for its form, both here and in ver. 9, Ewald, § 212

<p><a href="#v7.8">8</a>. <i>I long to climb</i>, &amp;c. After this flattering description Solomon tells the Shulamite how greatly he
desires, and how happy he should be to enjoy, the affections of one so lovely and
charming. We earnestly request those who maintain the allegorical interpretation of
the Song seriously to reflect whether this verse, and indeed the whole of this address,
can be put into the mouth of Christ as speaking to the Church. Would not our minds
recoil with horror were we to hear a Christian using it publicly, or even privately,
to illustrate the love of Christ for his Church?—<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אָמַר‎</span>, <i>to speak</i>, also <i>to wish</i>, <i>to desire</i>, Gen. xliv. 28; Exod. ii. 14; 1 Sam. xx. 4. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אָמַרְתִּי‎</span> does not express <i>the past</i>, but <i>the present</i>; comp. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דָמְתָה‎</span> in the preceding verse; Gesen. § 126, 3; Ewald, § 135 b. The second verb <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֶעֱלֶה‎</span> is subordinate to the first, <span lang="la">vide supra</span>, chap. ii. 3. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גֶּפֶן‎</span> is added to <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֶשְׁכֹּל‎</span>, to distinguish it from <i>the dates</i> in ver. 7.
</p>
<p><i>And the odour of thy breath</i>, &amp;c. That is, be as sweet and as quickening as that of apples. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אַף‎</span> is used in preference to <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פֶּה‎</span>, because the nostril, or the breathing (which <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אַף‎</span> literally means) is regarded by the Hebrews as that which in distension betokens
pleasure, anger, &amp;c. The appropriateness of this expression will be more manifest
when we remember that hitherto all that the Shulamite showed towards Solomon were
resistance and independence. There is also a play of words here, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אַף‎</span> being derived from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אָנַף‎</span>, <i>to breathe</i>, and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תַּפּוּחַ‎</span>, from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נָפַח‎</span>, <i>to breathe</i>. Hodgson strangely renders <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏וְרֵיחַ אַפֵף‎</span>, “the fragrance of <i>thy face</i>,” because several MSS. read <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אפיך‎</span> with a <i>yod</i>.
</p>
<p><a href="#v7.9">9</a>. <i>And thy speech</i>, &amp;c. That is, Let thy language to me be as the sweetness of delicious wine. Rosenmüller,
Döpke, De Wette, Noyes, Delitzsch, Hengstenberg, &amp;c., put these words into the mouth
of the maiden. But it is incredible that this modest woman would approve of these
expressions with regard to her own person, and that she would continue the words <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דּוֹבֵב שִׂפְתֵי יְשֵׁינִים‎</span>. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חֵךְ‎</span>, <i>palate</i>, metonymically for speech; <span lang="la">vide supra</span>, chap. v. 16. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏טוֹב‎</span> is used as a <i>substantive</i>, and placed in the genitive after <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יַיִן‎</span>; comp. Ps. xxi. 4; Prov. xxiv. 25; Ewald, § 287 b. The phrase <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הֹלֵךְ לְמֵישָׁרִים‎</span> describes the smooth or mellow wine, which is of a very superior quality, and highly
prized, Prov. xxiii. 31. The expression <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לְדוֹדִי‎</span> is added in order to describe still more forcibly the nature of the wine, and affords
a more striking illustration of the pleasantness of the damsel’s speech. Her voice
is not merely compared to wine, valued because it is sweet to everybody; but to such
wine as would be sweet to a friend, and on that account is more valuable and pleasant.
Ammon, Ewald, Heiligstedt, Hitzig, &amp;c. regard <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לְדוֹדִי‎</span> as having erroneously crept in here <span class="pageNum" id="pb182n">[<a href="#pb182n">182</a>]</span>from ver. 11, whilst Velthusen, Meier, &amp;c. point it <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לְדוֹדַי‎</span> in the plural; but this is unsupported by MSS. Hodgson, taking <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לְדוֹדִי‎</span> for <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לְדוֹדִים‎</span>, translates it <i>ad amores</i>, <i>delightfully</i>, corresponding to <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏<span class="corr" id="xd31e13233" title="Source: לִמֵישָׁרִיﬦ">לְמֵישָׁרִיﬦ</span>‎</span> in the next clause. But this rendering, to say the least, is contrary to the general
meaning of this word. The rendering of Williams, “which I sent to those whom I love
for their integrity,” is preposterous.
</p>
<p><i>And causes slumbering lips</i>, &amp;c. The wine is of such an animating nature, that it even causes silent lips to
speak. Thus Horace, Epist. lib. i. Ep. v. 19:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="la" class="lg">
<p class="line">Fecundi calices quem non fecere disertum? </p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">“Whom have not soul-inspiring cups made eloquent?” </p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">Others, however, with less probability, explain these words to mean wine of so excellent
a flavour, as to induce those who have indulged in it to dream of it, and converse
about it; or wine so delicious and tempting that it leads to excess, in consequence
of which the drinkers fall asleep, and then either disclose the subject of their dream,
or mutter unintelligible words. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דּוֹבֵב‎</span> is not <i>gently flowing</i>, <i>suffusing</i> (Ewald, Döpke, Gesenius, De Wette, Lee, Magnus, Noyes, Meier, Philippson, Hitzig,
&amp;c.), but <i>causing to speak</i> (Vulg., Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Rashbam, Mendelssohn, Kleuker, Hengstenberg, Fürst, Delitzsch,
&amp;c.) This is corroborated by the derivative <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דִּבָּה‎</span>, which primarily means <i>something spoken</i>, <i>a report</i>, either good or bad, as is evident from Gen. xxvii. 2; Numb. xiv. 37, where the adjective
<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רָעֳה‎</span>, <i>evil</i>, is joined to it; and from Ezek. xxxvi. 3, where it stands in parallelism with <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שְׂפַת לָשׁוֹן‎</span>, and by the frequent usage in the Talmud and other Hebrew writers of the word <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דָּבַב‎</span>, for <i>speaking</i>. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דּוֹבֵב‎</span> is the Poel of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דָּבַב‎</span>, a form frequently used in verbs <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ע״ע‎</span> (comp. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏<span class="corr" id="xd31e13290" title="Source: חֹולֵל">הֹולֵל</span>‎</span>, Eccl. vii. 7; <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏סוֹבֵב‎</span>, Ps. lix. 7; Gesen. § 67, 8), and, like the Piel, is often the <i>causative</i> of Kal, Gesen. § 55, 1. The Sept., Vulg., Sym., Syr., read <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שְׂפָתַיִﬦ וְשִׁנַּיִﬦ‎</span>, <i>the lips and the teeth</i>, instead of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שִׂפְתֵי יְשֵׁנִיﬦ‎</span>; but this is neither supported by MSS., nor yields a better sense.
</p>
<p><a href="#v7.10">10</a>. <i>I belong to my beloved</i>, &amp;c. The Shulamite gently but decidedly refuses the wishes of the king, declaring
that her affections are fixed on one whom she ardently loves, and on whom alone it
is her sacred duty to look. Even Ibn Ezra and Rashbam, though explaining it differently,
admit that the maiden here refuses the petitioner of the last verse on the plea that
she belonged to her beloved. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עָלַי‎</span>, lit. <i>on me</i>, i.e. <i>it is upon me as a duty</i>. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עַל‎</span> is frequently used to denote <i>duty</i> or <i>obligation</i>, which rests upon one like a burden, and must be discharged. Thus <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עָלַי לָתֵת‎</span>, “it was my duty to give,” 2 Sam. xviii. 11; <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏זִבְחֵי שְׁלָמִיﬦ עָלַי‎</span>, “peace-offerings are due from me,” Prov. vii. 14; Gesen. Lexicon, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עַל‎</span> A. 1, <span class="trans" title="a g"><span lang="grc" class="grek">α γ</span></span>. Ewald, § 217, 4 <span class="trans" title="g"><span lang="grc" class="grek">γ</span></span>. The suffix in <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תְּשׁוּקָתוֹ‎</span> expresses the object, i.e. <i>the desire for him</i>. This is often the case; comp. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יִרְאָתוֹ‎</span>, <i>his fear</i>, i.e. <i>the fear for him</i>, Exod. xx. 20; Gesen. § 121, 5; Ewald, § 286 b. We thus obtain the same sense of
this clause which Hodgson gives it, without changing the words into <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏זעליו תשוקתי‎</span>, upon the slender authority of one MS. to support the first, and three MSS. to support
the second alteration.
</p>
<p><a href="#v7.11">11</a><span class="corr" id="xd31e13375" title="Not in source">.</span> <i>Come, my beloved</i>, &amp;c. Having distinctly and finally refused the king, who forthwith quitted her, the
Shulamite now addresses her beloved shepherd, who approached her, urging their departure
from the royal palace for their festive bowers in Nature’s <span class="pageNum" id="pb183n">[<a href="#pb183n">183</a>]</span>hall. The want of separate names, or initial letters of names, generally used in profane
composition to indicate the speaker or the person spoken to, is amply supplied here
by the skill of the inspired poet in putting into the mouth of the Shulamite such
rural language as shows most plainly that she was a rustic maiden, and that her beloved,
whom she here addresses, is a shepherd. Comp. also chap. i. 7; ii. 8; v. 2, 4, &amp;c.
To ascribe these words to a princess addressing king Solomon is preposterous. Döderlein,
Ewald, Meier, &amp;c., take <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כְּפָרִיﬦ‎</span> as the plural of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כֹּפֶר‎</span>, <i>cypress</i>, <span lang="la">vide supra</span>, i. 14; iv. 13; but 1 Chron. xxvii. 25, where <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כְּפָרִיﬦ‎</span>, like here, coupled with <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שָׂדֶה‎</span>, <i>field</i>, forms a contrast to <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עִיר‎</span>, <i>city</i>, is against it. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הַשָּדֶה‎</span> is the accusative of place, 1 Sam. xx. 11; Gesen. § 118, 1.
</p>
<p><a href="#v7.12">12</a>. <i>We will go early</i>, &amp;c. Transported with the thought of her speedy arrival at her mother’s house, the
Shulamite vividly depicts to her beloved the scenes of home, where they will again
together enjoy rural life. It may be that Milton thought of this passage when he wrote
the words:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“To-morrow, ere fresh morning streak the east </p>
<p class="line">With first approach of light, we must be risen, </p>
<p class="line">And at our pleasant labour, to reform </p>

<p class="line">Our walks at noon with branches overgrown.” </p>

<p class="first xd31e13423"><i>Paradise Lost</i>, iv. 623, &amp;c.
</p>
<p><span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נַשְׁכִּימָה לַכְּרָמִים‎</span> is <i lang="la">constructio praegnans</i>, and is well explained by Rashbam, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נשכימה לטייל בכרמיﬦ‎</span>, “we will rise early to stroll in the vineyards.” Comp. Gen. xliv. 33; Numb. xiv.
24; Gesen. § 141.
</p>
<p><i>There will I give</i>, &amp;c. The shepherd, gladdened with the fact that his loved one is restored to him,
is desirous of expressing his joy and affection, but the Shulamite, anxious to get
off as quickly as possible, tells him that at home, amidst the charms of nature, they
may indulge in sweet effusions of love. The Sept. and Vulg. have here again <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏<span class="corr" id="xd31e13441" title="Source: דַּדִּים">דַּדַּיִם</span>‎</span>, <i>breasts</i>, instead of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דֹודִים‎</span>, <i>love</i>. But in addition to what has already been remarked, we would state that whenever
breasts are mentioned in this Song, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שָׁדַיִם‎</span> is invariably used.
</p>
<p><a href="#v7.13">13</a>. <i>The mandrakes diffuse</i>, &amp;c. Another reason for hastening away from the royal prison into the rural home.
There nothing will be wanting; they have there the highly prized apples, they have
all sorts of precious fruit, which she left on the trees for him. A similar passage
occurs in Virgil, <span class="corr" id="xd31e13462" title="Source: Eccl.">Ecl.</span> i. 37, where the loved one kept fruit on the tree for her lover:—

<p class="first"><span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דּוּדָאִים‎</span>, which occurs only once more, (Gen. xxx. 14), is, according to the testimony of the
ancient versions, the mass of commentators and modern travellers, <i>the mandrake-plant, Atropa mandragora</i>, called <i>yabrochack</i> by the Arabs, the fruit of which is highly valued by the Orientals for its supposed
exhilarating, aphrodisiac, and procreative properties. “It grows low, like lettuce,
to which its leaves have a strong resemblance, except that they have a dark green
colour. The flowers are purple, and the root is for the <span class="pageNum" id="pb184n">[<a href="#pb184n">184</a>]</span>most part forked. The fruit, when ripe, in the beginning of May, is of the size and

viz. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏על תפחינו‎</span>, <i lang="la">in nostris malis aureis</i>, instead of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏על פתחינו‎</span>, is an idle conjecture.

<p><a href="#v8.1">1</a>. <i>Oh that thou wert as my brother</i>, &amp;c. The charming description which the Shulamite gave of their happiness when at
home, recalled to her mind the obstacles which they met with, even there; and hence
she is led to wish that he had sustained to her the relation of a brother, that, whether
in the street or the house, none might misinterpret or interrupt the manifestation
of their attachment. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מִי יִתֵּן‎</span> is used to express the <i>optative</i>. Comp. Deut. v. 29; xxviii. 67; Ps. xiv. 7; Job vi. 8; Gesen. § 136, 1; Ewald, §
329 c. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כְּאָח‎</span> is the <i>accusative</i>. The rendering of the Septuag., <span class="trans" title="Tis dōē se, adelphide mou, thēlazonta mastous mētros mou?"><span lang="grc" class="grek">Τὶς δῴη σε, ἀδελφιδέ μου, θηλάζοντα μαστοὺς μητρός μου;</span></span> and Luther, “<span lang="de">O dass ich dich, mein Bruder, der du meiner Mutter Brüste saugest, draussen fände</span>,” are wrong. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יֹונֵק שְׂדֵי אִמִּי‎</span>, does not mean “an infant <i>still</i> sucking the breasts.” (Grotius, Gill, Good, Williams, &amp;c.), but “one who <i>had</i> sucked and is now a youth;” it is the second accusative to <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מִי יִתֶּנְךָ‎</span>, and stands in parallelism with <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אָח‎</span>, <i>brother</i>; like the participle <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יֹולֶדֶת‎</span> (which does not mean one who just gave birth), and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֵﬦ‎</span>, <span lang="la">vide supra</span>, chap. vi. 9. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏<span class="corr" id="xd31e13625" title="Source: אֶמְצָאָךָ">אֶמְצָאֲךָ</span>‎</span> is <i>conditional</i>, with the particle <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אִﬦ‎</span> implied, Judg. xi. 36; Prov. xxiv. 10; Ewald, § 367 b. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏גַם‎</span> is used poetically for <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏וְ‎</span>, <i>and</i>, Judg. v. 4; Joel i. 12. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יָבֻזוּ‎</span>: the third person is used to express the indeterminate third person, <i>the passive</i> in English.

and does not at all improve the sense.
</p>
<p><a href="#v8.2">2</a>. <i>I would lead thee</i>, &amp;c. As a brother, she could unreservedly bring him from the spot, where she met
him in the street, to her mother’s house. We must supply <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מִשָּׁם‎</span>, <i>thence</i>, before <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֱנְהָגְךָ‎</span>; so Rashbam.

The Septuagint
and Syriac, followed by Percy, entirely omit it, and interpolate here <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏וְאֶל חֶדֶר הוֹרָתִי‎</span>, <i>and into the apartment of her who gave me birth</i>, from chap. iii. 4; after <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בֵית אִמִּי‎</span>, <span class="pageNum" id="pb185n">[<a href="#pb185n">185</a>]</span><i>the house of my mother</i>. Ibn Ezra, the Authorized Version, Kleuker, Döderlein, Hitzig, &amp;c., supply <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֲשֶׁר‎</span>, <i>who</i>, before <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏תְּלַמְּדֵנִי‎</span>, and refer it to <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אִמִּי‎</span>, <i>my mother</i>. But this interrupts the construction, and, against the scope of the description,
introduces the mother as an actress. Hodgson and the editor of Calmet, strangely enough,
render it <i>Talmudni</i>, as a <i>proper name</i> of the maiden’s mother. The most natural way seems to be to take it with the Vulgate,
Chaldee, Rashbam, Luther, Ewald, Döpke, De Wette, Delitzsch, Hengstenberg, Philippson,
&amp;c., as the second person masculine.
</p>
<p><i>I would cause thee to drink</i>, &amp;c. On the aromatic wine, see supra, chap. vii. 3. The pomegranate-juice was and
still is a favourite beverage in the East. “The Orientals,” says Dr. Kitto, “indulge
largely in beverages made with fresh juice of various kinds of fruits. Among these,
sherbet made with pomegranate-juice is particularly esteemed, and, from its agreeable
and cooling acidity, the present writer was himself accustomed to prefer it to any
other drink of this description.” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יַיִן‎</span>, is either an anomalous <i>construct</i> (Gesenius; Fürst, Lex. s.v.), or the <i>absolute</i>, and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הַרֶקַח‎</span>, apposition in the accusative. Compare <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מַיִם לַחַץ‎</span>, 1 Kings xx. 27; Gesen. § 116, 6, Rem. b; Ewald, § 287 h. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֶשָׁקְךָ‎</span> and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֲשְׁקְךָ‎</span> are a paranomasia, <span lang="la">vide supra</span>, chap. i. 3. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עַסִיס רִמֹּנִי‎</span>, <i>my pomegranate-juice</i>, i.e. which I myself have prepared. The noun in the genitive, expressing the quality
of the nominative, has the suffix; compare <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הַר קָדְשִׁי‎</span>, <i>my holy mountain</i>, Ps. ii. 6; Gesen. § 121 b; Ewald, § 291 b. From an oversight of this most probably
arose the readings of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רמנים‎</span> or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רמונים‎</span> (several MSS.), <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רִמֹּנַי‎</span> (Vulgate, Syriac), the supposition that <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רִמֹּנִי‎</span> is an adjective (Schultens), and the opinion that it is an abbreviated plural from
<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רִמֹנִים‎</span>, like <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מִּנִּי‎</span> for <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מִנִּים‎</span>, (Ps. xlv. 9, Meier, Fürst, Lexicon, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מ‎</span>, 3 b.)
</p>
<p><a href="#v8.3">3</a>. <i>Let his left hand</i>, &amp;c. Exhausted with the attempt to describe her unfailing attachment for her beloved
shepherd, an attachment far deeper than external circumstances permit her to manifest,
the Shulamite desires that no other hand should raise her drooping head, no other
arm support her enfeebled frame, than those of her beloved; compare chap. ii. 6.
</p>
<p><a href="#v8.4">4</a>. <i>I adjure you</i>, &amp;c. This last affecting scene, having brought the Shulamite’s struggle to a successful
termination, is closed by her adjuring the court ladies as before (ii. 7, and v. 3),
to make no more attempt to draw her affections away from her beloved to any one else,
since they were unalterably fixed. The Septuagint, which is followed by Good, &amp;c.,
supplies here <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בִּצְבָאוֹת אוֹ בְּאַיְלוֹת הַשָּׂדֶה‎</span>, from ii. 7, and v. 3. It is obvious, from the change of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אִם‎</span> into the <i>more urgent</i> negative particle <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מַה‎</span>, (comp. Job xxxi.; Ewald, § 325 b), that the variation is designedly made; and indeed
the haste in which the Shulamite is to depart with her beloved does not permit her
to use the lengthy adjuration.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb186n">[<a href="#pb186n">186</a>]</span></p>
<p><a href="#v8.5">5</a>. <i>Who is it that comes up</i>, &amp;c. The last successful resistance secured for the Shulamite her liberty. Convinced
that even the blandishments of a king cannot overcome the power of virtuous love in
the heart of a rustic damsel; satisfied that “all the wealth of his house” could not
buy it, Solomon dismisses her. Then, reunited to her beloved shepherd, the happy pair
immediately depart for home. As they approach their native place the inhabitants,
beholding them at a distance, exclaim, “Who is it that comes up from the plain, leaning
upon her beloved?” <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הַמִּדְבָּר‎</span>, <i>the plain</i> (<span lang="la">vide supra</span>, iii. 6), most probably the plain of Esdraelon, at present known by the name of Merij
Ibn ’Amir, lying between Jezreel and Sulem (Robinson, Palestine, iii. 169), which
the lovers had to cross on their way home. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מִתְרַפָּקֶת‎</span> (from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רָפַק‎</span>, <i>to lean</i>; hence <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מַרְפֵּק‎</span>, <i>an arm</i>, on which one leans, Talm. Sabbath, 92), <i>supporting herself</i>, being weary with so long a journey. So the Sept. <span class="trans" title="epistērizomenē"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ἐπιστηριζομένη</span></span>; the Vulg. <i lang="la">innixa</i>, &amp;c. As for the additional <span class="trans" title="leleukanthismenē"><span lang="grc" class="grek">λελευκανθισμένη</span></span> in the Sept., and <i lang="la">deliciis affluens</i> in the Vulg., the one most probably arose from the word <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בָּרַה‎</span>, used in chap. vi. 10, where a similar question occurs, and the other from a marginal
gloss, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מתפנקת‎</span> or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מתנענעת‎</span>.
</p>
<p><i>Under this apple-tree</i>, &amp;c. As they drew nearer home they beheld the endeared spot—the memorable shady tree
under which the shepherd was born, and where their mutual love was first kindled.
These sweet musings are at length terminated by the Shulamite, who joyfully recounts
the pleasing reminiscences of that place. The frequent meetings of shepherds and shepherdesses
under shady trees, (<span lang="la">vide supra</span>, chap. i. 7), often resulted in the formation of a sacred tie. The solemn vow of
love was then engraven on the bark of the tree, as a witness of their union. Thus

<p><i>Here thy mother</i>, &amp;c. Confinements in the open air are of frequent occurrence in the East (Gen. xv.
16). “There are in Asia,” says Dr. Chardin in his manuscript notes, “large districts
in which no midwives are to be found, and even if some live there they are little
known, for mothers assist their daughters, and often female relatives or neighbours
fill the place of the former. In Kurman, I saw a woman who was delivered without any
assistance in <i>the open fields</i>, three hours from a village, and to my great surprise, she arrived not much later
in town where I was. The people there smiled at my astonishment, remarking that similar
cases were very frequent in their country.” (See Rosenmüller, Orient. i. 188; Paxton,
Illustrations of Scripture, i. 462; Kalisch on Exod. p. 18.) <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עוֹרֵר‎</span>, <i>to excite</i>, <i>to move to love</i>, <span lang="la">vide supra</span>, ii. 7; iii. 5; viii. 4. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חִבְּלָתְךָ‎</span> does not mean <i>conceived thee</i> (Aquila, Schultens, Hitzig, &amp;c.), which the Shulamite could not know, nor <i>plighted</i>, or <i>engaged thee</i>, (Houbigant, Michaelis, Percy, Kleuker, Good, Williams, Boothroyd, Magnus, Meier,
&amp;c.), which is contrary to the Piel signification of this verb, but signifies <i>laboured with thee</i>, (Sept., Syriac, Chaldee, Rashi, Rashbam, Ibn Ezra, Luther, Ewald, De Wette, Gesenius,
Philippson, &amp;c.); compare Ps. vii. 15, and Hupheld <i lang="la">in loco</i>. To put these words into the mouth of the bridegroom as addressing his bride, (Percy,
Good, Williams, Boothroyd, Delitzsch, Hitzig, &amp;c.), is contrary to the words in the
text, which have masculine suffixes. The form <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חִבְּלָתְךָ‎</span> is used instead of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חִבְּלַתְךָ‎</span>, to correspond in sound with <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יָלְדָתְךָ‎</span> in pause, <span lang="la">vide supra</span>, iii. 11. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יָלְרָתְךָ‎</span>, <i>i.q.</i> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יָלְדָה אוֹתְךָ‎</span>. The Vulgate, which seems here to savour of allegorism, translates <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שָׁמָּה חִבְּלָתְךָ אִמֶּךָ שָׁמָּה חִבְּלָּה יְלָדָתְךָ‎</span>, <i lang="la">ibi corrupta est mater tua, ibi violata est genitrix tua</i>. “The tree,” the Roman Catholics explain of <i>the cross</i>; “the individual” excited to love under it, <i>the Gentiles</i> redeemed by Christ at the foot of the cross; and “the deflowered and corrupted mother”
means, <i>the synagogue of the Jews</i> (the mother of the Church), which was corrupted by denying and crucifying the Saviour.
</p>
<p><a href="#v8.6">6</a>. <i>Oh, place me as a seal</i>, &amp;c. That is, “Let me be near and dear to thee.” The Shulamite, having shown her
faithfulness during a period of extraordinary trials, could now look up to the witnessing
tree with an inward satisfaction. It is therefore very natural that she should remind
her beloved, in the presence of this witness, of his vows. In ancient times, when
the art of writing was confined to a very few, and writing materials were not so easily
procurable, rings or signets, with names engraven upon them, were generally used as
manual signs. This contrivance for a signature soon became used as an ornament. People
who could afford it had these seals or signets made of silver or gold, inlaid with
precious stones. Being indispensable articles of use, and highly prized as decorations,
they were carried in the bosom, suspended from the neck by a string (Gen. xxxviii.
15), or were worn on the right hand (Jer. xxii. 24; Sirach xlix. 11), and thus became
a symbol of what is dear and indispensable. Jehovah himself uses this metaphor, Jer.
xxii. 24:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">

<p><i>For love is strong as death</i>, &amp;c. True love seizes with a tenacious grasp. Like death, it rules with resistless
sway; like Hades, it is never moved to give up its object: neither power nor prayer
can overcome it. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קָשָׁה‎</span>, <i>hard</i>, <i>firm</i>, <i>inexorable</i>. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קִנְּאָה‎</span> is not <i>jealousy</i> (Sept., Vulg., Authorized Version, Percy, Kleuker, Good, Williams, &amp;c.), but <i>devout affection</i>, <i>ardent love</i> (Ewald, Gesenius, De Wette, Noyes, Meier, Hitzig, Philippson &amp;c.); it is here used
as an intensitive term for <i>love</i>, as is evident from the parallelism and the connexion.
</p>
<p><i>The flames of the Eternal.</i> These words are exegetical of “flames of fire;” <i>i.e.</i> the flames of love, though having the same energy as those of fire, are not of the
same origin; they emanate from the Eternal, the source of all love. Whether, with
Ben Asher, we read <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שַׁלְהָבָתְיָהּ‎</span>, <i>conjointly</i>, like <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מַאֲפָלְיָהּ‎</span>, Jer. ii. 31; or with Ben Naphtali, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שַׁלְהֶבָת יָהּ‎</span>, <i>separately</i>, which is followed by most editions, Rashi, Ibn Ezra, and the majority of modern
critics, and which is required by the parallelism; this predicate does not state that
the flames of love are “most vehement,” but affirms that they emanate from the Eternal.
<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יָה‎</span>, an abbreviation of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יַהֲוֶה‎</span> (see <span class="corr" id="xd31e14025" title="Source: Kalish">Kalisch</span> on Exod. iii. 14; xi. 2; Fürst, Lexicon, s.v.), like <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֵל‎</span>, Isa. xiv. 13, is the genitive of cause or origin.

Fürst, Lexicon, s.v.; Gesen. § 55, 6; Ewald, § 122 a.

</p>
<p><a href="#v8.7">7</a>. <i>Floods cannot quench love.</i> Being a flame of celestial origin no terrestrial influence, however great, can destroy
or wash it away; it is not subjected to means resorted to for the extinction of ordinary
fires. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מַיִם רַבִּים‎</span>, prop. <i>much water</i>, i.e. a great quantity of it (Numb. xx. 11), <i>floods</i>. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שָׁטַף‎</span>, <i>to wash</i>, or <i>sweep away</i>, Job xiv. 19; Isa. xxviii. 17.

<p><i>If one should offer all</i>, &amp;c. Such divine love spontaneously flows from the heart, and cannot be purchased
with money; though one offered all his riches for it, they would be utterly despised.
This affirmation, whilst true in itself, is levelled against the king, who attempted
to gain love by flatteries and praises (<span lang="la">vide supra</span>, i. 11; vi. 8), but was utterly rejected (vii. 11). <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אִישׁ‎</span> <i>any one</i>, <i>one</i>, Gen. xiii. 16; Exod. xvi. 29; Gesen. § 122, Rem. 2. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בּוֹז‎</span>, the infinitive absolute, is employed before the finite verb <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יָבוּזוּ‎</span>, to express <i>intensity</i>, Gen. xliii. 3; 1 Sam. xx. 6; Gesen. § 131, 3 a; Ewald, § 280 b. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יָבוּזוּ‎</span>, the third person plural, is used for the passive, see supra, chap. viii. 1.

which they had once given to their sister if she kept virtuous, and, when espoused,
remained true to her vows. One of the brothers inquires of the others what they should
do for the Shulamite when she reached womanhood, and is demanded in marriage. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֲחוֹת לָנוּ‎</span>, <i>i.q.</i> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֲחוֹתֵינוּ‎</span>, <i>our sister</i>, and is well rendered by the Sept. <span class="trans" title="adelphē hēmōn"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ἀδελφὴ ἡμῶν</span></span>, the Vulg. <i lang="la">soror nostra</i>, Luther, <i lang="de">unsere Schwester</i>.

<p><a href="#v8.9">9</a><span class="corr" id="xd31e14195" title="Not in source">.</span> <i>If she be like a wall</i>, &amp;c. To this inquiry the second brother replied, that if, having reached that age,
she should firmly resist every allurement as a battlement resists the attack of an
enemy, they would decorate her as an impregnable wall; <i>i.e.</i> highly reward her. The expression “wall” is figuratively used for <i>impregnability</i>, Jer. ii. 18; so Immanuel, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שעמדה הזקה כהומה‎</span>. The silver turret here mentioned most probably refers to the <i>silver horn</i>, a highly prized ornament which women wear on their heads. “One of the most extraordinary
parts of the attire of their females” (Druses of Lebanon), says Dr. Macmichael, <span class="corr" id="xd31e14209" title="Not in source">“</span>is a silver horn, sometimes studded with jewels, worn on the head in various positions,
<i>distinguishing different conditions</i>. A married woman has it affixed to the right side of the head, a widow to the left,
and a virgin is pointed out by its being placed on the very crown. Over this silver
projection the long veil is thrown, with which they so completely conceal their faces
as to rarely have more than <i>one eye</i> (<span lang="la">vide supra</span>, chap. iv. 9), visible.” Comp. also Bowring, Report on Syria, p. 8.
</p>
<p><i>But if she be like a door</i>, &amp;c. That is, accessible (<span lang="la">vide supra</span>, chap. iv. 12), she shall be barricaded with cedar planks—be punished by being locked
up. The word “door” is metaphorically used for <i>open to seduction</i>. The cedar wood is mentioned because it is exceedingly strong, and increases the
idea of strict vigilance. Similarly Immanuel, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ואם דלת שכבר נפתח נצור עליה לרח ארז כלמ׳ נביאה במצור ונסגור בעדה שלﬡ תראה, וכלוה
אדז שהוה הזק ותקיף‎</span>.
</p>
<p><a href="#v8.10">10</a>. <i>I am a wall</i>, &amp;c. The Shulamite now triumphantly responds, that she had proved impregnable as
a wall, and had now reached womanhood, and therefore the promised reward was due to
her. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שָׁדַי כַּמִּגְדָלוֹת‎</span>, <i>i.q.</i> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שָׁדַי נָכֹנוּ‎</span>, Ezek. xvi. 7, is well explained by Rashbam, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הגיע זמני להינשא‎</span>, <i>my time for marriage has arrived</i>, and is an answer to <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שָׁדַיִם אֵין לָהּ‎</span>, in the preceding verse.
</p>
<p><i>Then I was in his eyes</i>, &amp;c. That <span class="pageNum" id="pb190n">[<a href="#pb190n">190</a>]</span>is, in her brother’s eyes. He now, being convinced of his sister’s chastity, gave
her the reward of virtue. The suffix in <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בְּעֵינָיו‎</span>, <i>his eyes</i>, does not refer to Solomon (Ewald, Hitzig, Philippson, &amp;c.), whose name has not been
mentioned, but to the brother (Ibn Ezra, &amp;c.), who last spoke. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שָׁלוֹם‎</span>, <i>peace</i>, has no reference to the name <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שְׁלֹמֹה‎</span>, but is used in the sense of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חַן‎</span>, <i>favour</i>, and refers to chap. i. 6; comp. Gen. xxxiv. 7 with ver. 11.
</p>
<p><a href="#v8.11">11</a>. <i>Solomon had a vineyard</i>, &amp;c. Having been obliged, when demanding her promised reward, to describe her virtue
as an impregnable wall, the Shulamite now relates more circumstantially how she had
resisted the attempt to gain her affections. Solomon had a large vineyard in Baal-hammon,
which he offered to consign to her if she granted his request; but the Shulamite refused
his offer, telling him he might keep his large estate to himself, for she was quite
satisfied with her humble possession. Many are the conjectures hazarded as to the
locality of Baal-hammon, which occurs nowhere else, and no place is known by this
name. It is taken for Baal-Gad, or <i>Heliopolis</i> (Rosenmüller, Bib. Geog. ii. p. 253), for <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חַמּוֹן‎</span>, <i>Hammon</i>, a place in the tribe of Asher, Josh. xix. 28 (Ewald), and for <span class="trans" title="Belamōn"><span lang="grc" class="grek">Βελαμὼν</span></span> or <span class="trans" title="Balamōn"><span lang="grc" class="grek">Βαλαμὼν</span></span>, <i>Belamon</i> or <i>Balamon</i>, a place mentioned in the book of Judith, viii. 3, not far from the plain of Esdraelon,
Judith iii. 9 (Meier, Hitzig). It is, however, more probable, according to Rashi,
that Baal-hammon was in or near Jerusalem, and was called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בַּעַל הַמּוֹן‎</span>, <i>place of the multitude</i>, because its beauties and charms attracted a multitude of people, thus presenting
a greater temptation for the Shulamite. The Vulgate strangely renders <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כֶּרֶם הָיָה לִשְׁלֹמֹה בְּבַעַל הַמּוֹן‎</span>, <i lang="la">vinea fuit pacifico in ea, quae habet populos</i>.
</p>
<p><i>He let out the vineyard</i>, &amp;c. This is intended to show the value of the vineyard. It was so extensive that
it was leased out to a number of tenants, and every one of them paid a thousand shekels
annually, and yet had two hundred shekels left for himself. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נֹטְרִיﬦ‎</span>, an <i>indefinite</i> number of keepers or farmers. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אִישׁ‎</span> <i>each</i>, <span lang="la">vide supra</span>, ver. 7. The suffix in <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בְפִרְיוֹ‎</span>, <i>his fruit</i>, refers to <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כֶּרֶם‎</span>, <i>vineyard</i>, which is masculine. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כֶּסֶף‎</span>, <i>silver</i>, stands for <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שֶׁקֶל כֶּסֶף‎</span>, <i>silver shekel</i>: substantives denoting <i>weight</i>, <i>measure</i>, or <i>time</i>, are frequently omitted. Gen. xx. 16; xxxvii. 28; Acts xix. 9; Gesen. § 120, 4, Rem.
2; Ewald, § 287 i. The amount of a shekel is supposed to be about two shillings and
sevenpence. The shekel of the sanctuary, however, like all the weights and measures
of the Temple, was computed at double the ordinary. See Ezek. xlv. 12; 1 Kings x.
17; comp. with 2 Chron. ix. 16; Mishna, Shekalim, Maaser Sheni; <span class="corr" id="xd31e14366" title="Source: Wiener">Winer</span>, Bib. Dict. s.v. A thousand shekels, therefore, would be about one hundred and thirty
pounds. Remembering that each of these farmers had to pay this sum annually, and that
money in those days had fifteen or twenty, nay, according to Michaelis (Mos. Rech.
§ 243), fifty times its present value, we shall be able to judge of the allurement
which this ample estate offered.
</p>
<p><a href="#v8.12">12</a>. <i>I will keep my own vineyard</i>, &amp;c. And yet, notwithstanding all this, the Shulamite prefers to keep her little
vineyard, and be with her beloved shepherd, rather than unfaithfully give him up for
riches and honours. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כַּרְמִי שֶׁלִּי‎</span>, <i>my own vineyard</i>, the vineyard which belongs to me; <span lang="la">vide supra</span>, chap. i. 6. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לְפָנָי‎</span> lit. <i>is before me</i>; <i>it is <span class="pageNum" id="pb191n">[<a href="#pb191n">191</a>]</span>mine, and I will keep it</i>: this is obvious from the immediately following <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏לְךָ‎</span>, <i>thine</i>, <i>keep thou it</i>. The words <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הָאֶלֶף לְךָ וגו״‎</span> are to be taken as an exclamatory phrase, Ewald, § 329 a. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אֶלֶף‎</span> is here used <i>collectively</i> for all the thousands put together, which come in annually from the farmers; so <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מָאתַיִם‎</span>, <i>the two hundreds</i>. The Vulgate translates here again the proper <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שְׁלֹמֹה‎</span>, <i lang="la">mille tui pacifici</i>.
</p>
<p><a href="#v8.13">13</a>. <i>O thou that dwellest in the gardens</i>, &amp;c. The companions of the shepherd, who had manifested their joy at the successful
arrival of the happy pair (<span lang="la">vide supra</span>, ver. 5), and rejoice that one of their humble occupation has brought such honour
upon the whole class, visit the Shulamite, to hear from her own mouth her avowed attachment
to her beloved. The shepherd, therefore, requests her to gratify this desire. She
is no more <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הַיּוֹשֶׁבֶת בְּחַדְרֵי הַמֶּלֶךְ‎</span>, <i>sitting in the apartments of the king</i>, <span lang="la">vide supra</span>, chap. i. 4, but has the honourable appellation of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הַיּוֹשֶׁבֶת בַּגָנִים‎</span>, <i>dwelling in the gardens</i>. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חֲבֵרִיﬦ‎</span>, <i>companions</i>, i.e. my companions, fellow-shepherds, i. 8.
</p>
<p><a href="#v8.14">14</a>. <i>Haste, O my beloved</i>, &amp;c. The Shulamite complies with the request. In the presence of all, she calls <i>the shepherd</i> her beloved, and tells him always to hasten to her with the speed of the swift-footed
gazelle; <span lang="la">vide supra</span> ii. 9, 17. He has no more to cross “the mountains of separation” (see ii. 17), for
they are united. These rugged mountains have now given place to the much-wished-for
<i>aromatic hills</i>, iv. 6.

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

forth in Section 3 below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

<div style='display:block; font-size:1.1em; margin:1em 0; font-weight:bold'>
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
